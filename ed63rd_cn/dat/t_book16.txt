43|Chapter 18 - The Duel Between Red and Blue     White blade met deadly claw. Blue and redtwisted about in blinding fashion. The cover tothe fight had been cleaved off.    'Ohhhh, you're moving better,' Harlequinexclaimed.    Surprisingly, the Blue Knight's movementswere just a little bit faster than that of thecrimson devil puppet, Calamity.     'I broke it aaall to pieces, too, but　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4to fix it back up in just one day... Looks likethe old man found himself a good apprentice.'    'You know my master?'    Harlequin twirled his fingers and Calamityfluttered its wings and slowly lifted into thesky.    'We have a bit of a history, yes.' Hegiggled. 'But forget about that. What'll you doabout THIS?!'    As he howled these words, the red puppetswooped down. Pedro pulled his strings back andthe Blue Knight narrowly avoided the grasping　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4claws.     'Or this?'    Smooth as flowing water, Calamity sent outits log-like tail to swipe at the knight.    Pedro's threads flowed down and to theright. Dropping its center of gravity, the BlueKnight shifted its sword to a slant andredirected the force of the tail upwards.    'OR THIS?!'    Calamity swung its horned head around andcharged straight for the Blue Knight's torso.　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    Pedro snapped his threads upwards and to hisleft this time. The Blue Knight, who had letitself fall slightly back, now slashed its sworddown in a blur of light.     With a small, pleasant cracking sound, thecrimson wing on the right side of the puppet washewn straight off.    　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第１８话　赤与青的决战　交错的白刃与凶爪。缠斗不已的赤与青令人眼花缭乱。战斗早已拉开了帷幕。　『哦，动作变灵活了嘛？』令人惊讶的是，苍骑士的动作甚至比恶魔人偶『灾厄』还要略胜一筹。　『本来都已经散架了，　　　　　　　　　　 １／４　居然还能在一天之内修复。　老头子真是收了个好徒弟啊』　『你认识我师父吗？』『以前算是有点因缘』灾厄迎风展开双翼，缓缓浮上天空。　『好，那么这招如何？』它一声咆哮，俯冲下来。佩德罗将丝线拉向身后，苍骑士一个后撤步，躲过了　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４从头顶上袭来的巨大利爪。　『那么，这招又如何？』灾厄行云流水般将原木似的尾巴横扫过来。佩德罗将丝线转向右下。苍骑士压低下盘，斜举着剑将尾巴挡向上方。　『那这下怎么样！？』灾厄甩动长角的头部，朝着苍骑士的身体顶了过来。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４佩德罗将丝线弹向左上。苍骑士的身体斜向后倾，以闪电般的速度挥下一剑。　伴随着一声脆响，绯红色的右翼应声而落。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

1724|Chapter 19 - Red Hot Roar     Slightly panicked, the masked puppeteerwrenched back on the strings and put spacebetween himself and the Blue Knight.    'Hey, how about we call it a draw here?'    Knowing it was hopeless, Pedro stilloffered.    As he expected, a happy voice called back.    'Now, don't make bad jokes like that. It'sbeen too long since I've had this much fun,after all!'　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    Seemingly drunk on warped joy, Harlequintwisted his hands about in a complex motion. Itlooked almost as if he were drawing magiccircles in the air.    'I didn't think I'd end up using this...' hegiggled.    Calamity crossed both arms across its body,as if holding itself.    Slowly, a burning scent filled the air.A cold chill ran down Pedro's spine. He set tomoving the Blue Knight, but realized theprincess was behind it.　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4     'You can regret it in your next liiifffeee!'Harlequin screamed.    The crimson demon took an imposing stance.Its massive jaw creaked. There was a rushing ofair, and then a ball of brilliant flame spewedforth.    The area was engulfed in a violent pillar ofswirling fire. The Blue Knight, Pedro, and theprincess were all swallowed by the inferno.    'Tch, so that's it, is it... Guess it waskind of a pity to end it there, huh?'　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    Gazing at the roaring flames, Harlequinmuttered regretfully. However, his eyes soonnarrowed, puzzled. No scent of meat roasting ormetal melting reached his nose.     'WHAT?!'     The crimson maelstrom began to swirl faster,and the center suddenly parted as if blown apartfrom the inside. From the middle rose a bluetwister. 　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第１９话　灼热的咆哮　绯红的翅膀飘落在地。蒙面人偶师慌忙地与苍骑士拉开距离。　『喂，就此休战吧？』虽然知道不可能，佩德罗仍然建议道。果不其然，对方回答的声音中充满了愉悦。『这么开玩笑可不行啊。　我已经好久没遇见过如此有趣的事了！』　　　　　　　　　　　 １／４哈雷克因似乎沉浸在扭曲的欣喜之中，双手开始复杂地运动，简直就像是在描绘魔法阵一般。　『没想到我会被迫用出这招……』灾厄交叉双臂，抱紧身体缩成一团。　一丝焦糊味传了过来。佩德罗感到脊背一阵发冷。他急忙想要操纵苍骑士行动，忽然发觉公主就在身后。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４　『到那个世界后悔去吧！』红色恶魔展开全身，昂然挺立。刹那间，巨大的口中喷出了通红的火球。　被击中的地方立刻窜起了冲天的火柱。苍骑士与佩德罗，以及缇雅公主都被卷入灼热之中。　『切，就这么完了吗……　我是不是太过分了呢？』　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４注视着火势的蔓延，哈雷克因略显遗憾地低声说道。然而，他马上就怀疑地眯起眼睛。空气中完全闻不到烤焦肉体或是烧熔金属的烟味。　『怎么会！？』仿佛要吹散灼热的火焰一般，一阵苍青旋风席卷而上。　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

3480|Chapter 20 - The Whereabouts of the Deathmatch     From within the flame, the Blue Knightarose. Across its shoulders, Pedro and PrincessTia could be seen clinging, hale and hearty.     What had blown away the raging flames wasits tremendous two-handed sword. Spinning theenormous blade like a whirlwind, a butterflymade of flame danced above the Blue Knight'shead. It was a fantastical scene. 　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    'Kh... You think that'll work?!'    Harlequin began gesturing again. It seemedhe intended to launch another fireball.     'I won't let you!' Pedro cried.    Splitting through the wall of flames, theBlue Knight forced its way forward. In the nextmoment, Calamity's horned head wascleaved perfectly in two.     'Ahaha... Absolutely...wonderful...'    The fireball, moments from release, puffed　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4up within the crimson puppet and caused a smallexplosion.    Flung by the shockwave, the Blue Knight wastossed into the air. Pedro braced both legs andmanaged to catch it.    'Sir Pedro, are you all right?!'    'I'm fine, yeah... But, I don't thinkthere's any saving him.'    Though Harlequin may have been a foe, hiswas still a life that had been taken. Pedro feltthe guilt of such a deed strike him. PrincessTia, seeing Pedro so troubled, enveloped him in　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4her arms.    '...I'd appreciate it if ya wouldn't killme off so easily,' said a whispering voice frominside the pillar of flames. The voice seemedsomehow satisfied.    'I applaud your efforts, young man. I'llback down nicely this time. Looking forward towhen we next meet. Ahaha...'    The ground shook and a red and black shadowlaunched skyward and disappeared from sight.    Pedro and the princess looked at one anotherand burst into relieved laughter.　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第２０话　死斗的结局　苍骑士屹立在火焰之中。在他身后，是佩德罗和公主神采奕奕的身影。　吹散狂乱火焰的是一柄双手巨剑。宽阔的刀刃如风车般旋转，在苍骑士的头顶上，火焰化蝶般飞舞而下。那简直是梦幻般的景象。　　　　　　　　　　　 １／４『唔，就用那种东西！？』哈雷克因双手画起了印记。看来是打算再发出一记火球。　『休想得逞！』苍骑士劈开火焰，迅速逼近灾厄，一瞬之后，恶魔长角的头部便被斩为两半。　『哈哈哈……干得……漂亮………』即将发射的火球膨胀开来，　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４引发了小规模的爆炸。苍骑士被爆破产生的气流吹向半空。佩德罗努力稳住双腿，才勉强让苍骑士平安着陆。　『佩德罗先生，没事吧！？』『我没什么……　不过，那家伙是没救了吧』虽说是敌人，但也不必夺去别人的性命。佩德罗心中充斥着罪恶感。缇雅公主从佩德罗身后紧紧抱住了他。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４　『……不要随便就当我死了啊』从火柱之中传来低语声。那是一种获得满足般的语气。『这次，我就老老实实地退下吧。　真期待我们下次的相见。哈哈哈……』伴随着地面的震动，赤黑色的身影看样子从火柱的对面离去了。　佩德罗和公主面面相觑，一同爆发出一阵笑声。　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

5365|Chapter 21 - The Dollmaster's Purpose     The boy, the girl, and one puppet left forthe capital on light feet while the maskedpuppeteer fled into the deep forest riding hisscorched creation.    Stopping suddenly, the masked puppeteerspoke to the shadows in the trees.    'You're there, aren't you, old man?'    'Hmph. Noticed me, did you...'    Pedro's master, Capri, stepped out from thecover of the trees. As always, the Black Priest　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4was with him, but it was a curious sight, forthe puppet had no arms.    'As I thought, you fixed the blue puppet'sarms with parts from the Black Priest. No wonderit moved so well.'    'Well, the gap between you and Pedro wasa bit too much, after all. I took it upon myselfto give him a helping 'hand'.'     Harlequin's shoulders sunk in response tothe words of the old puppet master.    'Well, I don't mind, since I had fun. But...　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4If and when the Thirteen Factories finds outabout this, I don't think Pedro will have it tooeasy either, do you?'     The Thirteen Factories.    The moment he heard those disturbingwords, Capri's expression darkened.     'Ahaha. Well, then...see you soon.'    Leaving behind a suppressed laugh, the maskedpuppeteer disappeared into the deep forest. 　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    'It is a road all puppeteers must pass...'the old puppet master muttered in a quiet voice,almost as if he was telling it to himself.         　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第２１话　人偶师们的思绪　少年少女和一只人偶脚步轻快地走向王都……与此同时，蒙面人偶师乘着烧焦的人偶，直冲进密林深处。　他忽然间停住脚步，对着树荫说道。『你在吧，卡普利老头子？』『嗯。被发现了吗……』佩德罗的师父卡普利出现在那里。和往常一样，『黑法师』也在一起。　　　　　　　　　　 １／４然而奇怪的是，人偶的双臂不见了。　『果然如我所料，蓝色人偶的双臂　是用黑法师的零件修好的啊。　难怪动作那么敏捷』『嗯，因为佩德罗和你比起来，　实力相差过于悬殊了嘛。　所以你也就作些让步吧』　面对若无其事的老人偶师，哈雷克因耸了耸肩。『唉，反正我这回也尽兴了，就这么算了吧。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４　不过，如果这件事被『十三工房』知道了的话，　佩德罗君可没这么简单就能了事吧？』　十三工房。一听到这诡异的词语，卡普利的表情立刻变得僵硬起来。　『哈哈哈。那么，不久之后再会吧』留下阵阵暗笑，蒙面人偶师消失在密林深处。　『人偶师总有一天要走上这条路……』　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４老人偶师沉静地喃喃说道。就好像是在说给自己听一般。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

6909|Final Chapter - A Moment's Rest     Afternoon in the palace began with a teaparty in the gardens. The princess, as always,filled three cups with black tea from the pot.     'Please, enjoy your tea.'    'Thank you very much,' Pedro said.     Behind the boy sipping tea stood a knightarmored in blue. However, he had not a word tosay.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 5    'What happened to the duke in the end?'    On the night of the crowning ceremony, DukeGaston had disappeared with his vassals. Afterall, his plan had been foiled and the queensuccessfully crowned before countlesscountrymen.    The royal guard, whose allegiance had beenquestionable before the coronation, fell totheir knees in contrition and swore theirloyalty to the new queen. The duke, before hecould be held for the crime of abducting theprincess, understandably chose to flee the　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 5country.    'My uncle has chosen to entrust himself tothe Empire. Apparently he's sought protectionfrom the Imperial prince that he had arranged asa husband for me.'    The queen smiled slightly.    'However...it seems as if they consider himsomething of a pest. I feel a bit sorry forhim.'    Pedro was amazed.   'They do not deserve your sympathy!'    In truth, Pedro did not think Duke Gaston　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 5would back down easily. And what of themachinations of that foul masked puppeteer,Harlequin? Capri, Pedro's teacher, seemed toknow the jester, but simply dodged any questionsabout him with frustrating vagueness.Regardless, Pedro knew another battle wouldcome...and soon. He would have to upgrade theBlue Knight if he hoped to emerge victorious.     'Oh, Pedro...'    A slightly irritated, yet comforting, voicesnapped Pedro from his reverie. 　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 5    'Do you wish for your tea to grow cold?'    The clear blue eyes which met his owncarried their own message: 'It will be allright.'      Pedro, a little embarrassed, took his teaand drank deeply. It was enough to simply havethis moment...with her.        The End　　　　　　　　　　 5 / 5|最终话　大团圆～片刻的安宁　王宫的午后，是从中庭的茶会开始的。公主同平时一样拿起茶壶向两只杯子中斟满红茶。　『来，请慢用』『不客气了』在端起茶杯的少年身后，站着身穿蓝色甲胄的骑士。然而，他一直没有开口。　　　　　　　　　　　 １／５『最后，公爵到底怎么样了？』加冕仪式当晚，加斯顿公爵带着家臣一同躲了起来。毕竟公主已经在众多国民面前宣布了即位。静观事态演变的禁卫骑士团也全部下跪，对新女王宣誓效忠。这也难怪公爵会在因绑架公主被问罪之前企图逃亡了。　『叔父去了帝国。　似乎在之前预定同我结婚的二皇子　　　　　　　　　　 ２／５　那边有些门路呢』说到这里，女王扑哧一笑。『不过……对方　明显觉得他是个大麻烦。　真是有点可怜呢』　『不用同情这种人啦。　真是的，缇雅陛下太善良了』说实话，佩德罗无论如何也没有想到加斯顿公爵会就此作罢。　　　　　　　　　　　 ３／５此外，诡异的蒙面人偶师哈雷克因的动向也令人在意。虽然似乎彼此相识，可是卡普利师父一直含糊其词，什么都没有说。反正，在不远的将来必定还会有一场骚乱。佩德罗决心要对苍骑士进行改造。　『真是的，佩德罗先生』稍显任性的语气让佩德罗回过神来。　　　　　　　　　　 ４／５『茶要凉了哦？』那清爽透彻的眼眸映出蓝天，调皮地闪耀着，好像在说『没问题』一样让人安心。　害羞的佩德罗端起微温的红茶润了润喉咙。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　人偶骑士·完　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ５／５
