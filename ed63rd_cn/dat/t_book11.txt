42|Chapter 7 - The Banquet of Darkness    The ship was utterly silent as it cut through thevelvety darkness of the night. In contrast to the stillnessand inky black of the outside, one layer down the ship'sinterior was filled with light and sound. Furnishingsfrom every part of the continent adorned the walls, and aband of musicians played a cheery song... The orbal glowof a chandelier imported from Liberl shone down on everyform of human desire.     In the hall built at the center of the ship, guests　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 7	laughed and chatted. They appeared to be the finest ofladies and gentlemen, but each and every one were a partof the seedy Republican underworld. They were the typeof folk that spoke of murder as easily as one would dinneror a fine wine. Their faces hadn't changed much in sevenyears.    The farthest depths of the hall reserved discreetseating for the highest ranked of the lot, and just likebefore, there was a certain group of men there. Oneold man, who was flanked by several bodyguards,stood out in particular: Chief Minister Shamrock. He　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 7	happened to be the host of the party aboard the ship.     A long, white beard trailed down his chest. It was hissymbol, and also the symbol of power. Though he retiredseveral years before, he continued to serve in an advisoryrole to many organizations. Retirement had done nothingto slow his influence on the nation; he was a man wellworthy of being called the monster of the underworld.    Chief Minister Shamrock held this party once every yearas a place for the powerful to meet and share usefulinformation. Of course, there were many in the group who　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 7	could hardly be called friendly in their attitude. Two ofthese such men were Enrique and Won.     Enrique, both seven years ago and now, was theman behind arranging Jack's fateful gambling matches.Formerly an arms dealer, he had expanded his dealingsto smuggling drugs within the Eastern Quarter a decadeprior and never looked back. For that, he became avillain on the rise--the best of the new class.    Conversely, Won was a villain whose roots ran deep inthe region back to even before the Eastern Quarter. He　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 7	was the kind of man who ruled from the top, commandinggangs of thugs, punks, and the like. For as long as thetwo were in the same business, Enrique and Won hadbeen locked in a vicious territorial dispute. It was theclassic tale of new versus old, and neither side yieldeda rege. Every drop of blood in their attempts to claimdominance was only washed away with more blood.   However easy it was to wash away, the constantsplattering of blood across pavement did little to bringin the mira for either side. It took three years ofprofitless violence for Enrique to finally propose a　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 7	solution: a one-on-one gambling match between the bestof the best. Even cheating was welcome, for it couldhardly be called cheating at all if one was never caughtin the act.   Won's first instinct was to reject the idea, buteven he could see the heavy toll the fighting hadtaken on his own organization. Truly, the only thingkeeping him from agreeing was his old-fashioned,stubborn mentality; he was, at his core, a man greatlyadverse to change. 　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 7	   In order to set his plans in motion, Enrique broughthis proposal forward to none other than Chief MinisterShamrock, who also served as advisor to Won'sgroup. With him having granted the match hisblessing, there was little more Won could do butaccept.     　　　　　　　　　　  7 / 7|第７回　黑夜中的晚宴　船悄无声息地，平稳地航行在黑暗之中。　与静谧的船外相反，仅仅相隔一层钢板的船内，则充斥着各式各样的灯光和嘈杂声。有从大陆各地收集来的日常用品，还有一群奏响欢快乐曲的演奏家……从王国进口的水晶吊灯发出的灯光，照遍了人类欲望的每个角落。　　　　　　　　　　 １／７在位于船体中心的大厅，乘客们在用过晚餐后正饶有兴致地聊着天。　尽管这些人都以绅士自居，但其实他们都是活跃于共和国阴暗面的权势者。这些家伙会在美酒佳肴与打牌的闲暇之间，商量接下来要除掉哪个人。他们的组成和７年前比起来变化倒不算太大。　在整个大厅的最深处，设有极为隐蔽的贵宾席——和７年前一样，那里坐着一群男人。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／７一位老人被身强力壮的保镖们簇拥着，他就是这次宴会的主办者，夏姆洛克大佬。　蓄到肚脐处的白色美髯既是他本人的象征，同时也是权威的象征。虽然他在多年前就已经退离现役，但至今仍担任数个组织的顾问，其影响力至今仍未见减弱，他简直可以称得上是黑社会中的怪物。　由这位夏姆洛克大佬　　　　　　　　　　 ３／７举办的每年一度的船内宴会也就成为了权势者们交换重要情报的场所。　话虽如此，这里面也有些感觉不怎么友善的人。比如恩力克与渥恩。　恩力克就是策划了７年前以及这第２次扑克比赛的人物。　他原本是贩卖导力器与军火的商人，但在１０年前开始与东方人街进行贸易后　　　　　　　　　　 ４／７就开始染指药物走私，很快扩大了自己的势力，成为新崛起的恶徒。　而另一方面，渥恩在东方人街出现之前就已经是盘踞在这一带的恶徒，他是能够号令流氓无赖等黑道势力的组织中的头号人物。　这１０年来，东方人街成为了恩力克与渥恩两个新旧势力争夺的中心。双方互不相让，一直不断重复着血债血偿的斗争。　　　　　　　　　　 ５／７　在这种情形之下，７年前恩力克提出以扑克比赛一决雌雄。那是在最强的赌博师之间进行的，允许作弊的１对１决斗。他向渥恩提出凭借这场比赛的胜负决定双方在东方人街的势力范围，以这种方式尽可能减少无益的斗争。　起初渥恩并不同意这个计划。当然，如果斗争就那样持续下去也会给他的组织带来沉重的打击。　　　　　　　　　　 ６／７但是，思想顽固的渥恩决不是一个能够轻而易举地相信新奇理念的男人。　恩力克把这个想法告诉了夏姆洛克大佬。随后，大佬便同意举行决斗。　大佬同时也负责劝说渥恩一伙，但既然大佬都已经同意了，渥恩也不得不接受这次对决。　　　　　　　　　　　　 ７／７

3753|Chapter 8 - Halle    The clock chimed the 11th hour.    The match between Jack and Halle was to start atmidnight exactly. She waited in the interim in Enrique'sroom.    'Your father became ill and died seven years ago.'That's what the girl had heard from her mother, and yetthree years ago, she learned her father had insteadlost his life in a match.    Halle didn't have many memories of her father. She'dspent her childhood with her mother. That was exactly　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 7	why, though, that each and every one was engraved intoher heart as irreplaceable treasures.    The things she remembered best were the sights in thegambling dens. She didn't often get to go along, but to her,the way her father could silence even the most finelydressed of gentlemen with his near-magical card handlingwas something she admired with all her heart.     The last memory Halle had was of him taking her handwhile she was in bed and telling her not to worry.    Maybe that memory was what kept her from believing　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 7	what her mother said about her father's death. After all,how could the strong, healthy man from that memory dropdead of illness so suddenly? It was a typical day when she had learned the truth.She was out shopping for her mother, and rather thantake the usual route home, she found herself headingto one of the gambling dens along the back streets ona whim.   One fateful whim. That was all it took for her tooverhear the careless chatter of thugs who spoke of her　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 7	father. It had been seven years, yes, but it was a matchof the ages--a match which still ushered in ferventwhispers among the men and women who frequented thedarker corners of the gambling world.   The truth left her with a hatred so all-consumingthat she was blind to all but one desire: revenge.     Swearing she would become as good as her father,Halle obsessively frequented the gambling dens andplayed with that one burning desire guiding her hands.    It was Enrique who, upon hearing rumors, approached　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 7	Halle first. He had claimed victory in his first matchagainst Won by betting on Jack; with Halle, he saw hischance to do so again.    Anyone could see that, to Halle, participating in sucha match would be a perfect means to an end.   Cutting all ties with her mother was a sad butnecessary sacrifice, and though she was young, she waswelcomed as the newest addition to Enrique's group.Being blessed with talent to begin with and havingabandoned all else to focus on improving her craft, it took　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 7	a mere three years for her to master what King hadspent a lifetime studying. Revenge had proven to be anincredible motivator.     Halle's eyes were distant as she waited quietly for thematch. Perhaps those three years were running throughthem. Still seated, she bowed her head and let out a big,long sigh.    'No need to let the weight of this drag you down, youknow,'  Enrique said softly to her.    '...Don't worry,' she replied. 'Now that I'm here,　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 7	my heart is as light as a feather.'    Her face betrayed the lie in her words as a flicker ofsorrow creased her features. Before anyone could notice,she was back to the same poker face as before.   'Right now, the only thing on my mind is seeing Jacklose.'     Enrique's lips contorted into a smile. The moreconfident he grew in his victory, the more disturbinglywarped his smile became. 　　　　　　　　　　  7 / 7|第８回　哈璐　时针指向深夜１１点。杰克与哈璐的对决将在０点开始。哈璐在恩力克的房间里等待着那一刻的到来。　『你的父亲　在７年前病逝了。』　母亲对她这样解释，而听信这种说法长大的少女却在３年前得知了父亲是因决斗而身亡的这一事实——　　　　　　　　　　　 １／７她大多数时间都是与母亲一起度过的，因此关于父亲的记忆并不算多。　但是正因为如此，父亲才会更显得无可替代，在她心中打下了深刻的烙印。　她记忆最深刻的仍然是赌场的样子，尽管父亲并不常带她去，但那拥有着能令那些穿着讲究的绅士们都目瞪口呆的魔法一般华丽牌技的父亲，令当时的自己仰慕至极。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／７　哈璐最后一段关于父亲的回忆，就是那在她卧床不起时握着她的手，用『放心吧』鼓励她的父亲的身影。也许正是因为有这段记忆，她无论如何都无法相信母亲告诉她的父亲的死讯。最后一次见到父亲时，他和平常一样健康，实在无法想象他随后就会病逝。　后来有一次，她在帮母亲进城购物时，忽然一时兴起走向位于小巷里的赌场。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／７在那里无意间听到小流氓们的闲聊以后，她立刻察觉出了父亲真正的死因。对于赌场的常客而言，７年前那场对决实在是太著名了。　在得知真相之后，她只被一种感情支配着，那就是向杰克复仇的心。她发誓要将技艺磨练到父亲的境界，于是开始频繁地出入赌场。　恩力克则是在传言中听到了关于她的事情之后，　　　　　　　　　　 ４／７开始向她寻求合作。在７年前，由于杰克的获胜，他也在与渥恩的斗争中取得了胜利，而这次他又在王的女儿哈璐身上发现了战胜杰克的机会。于是，他提出要重演对决。　这意见正中哈璐下怀，她和母亲断绝了联系，寄身于恩力克的组织之中。她舍弃了一切，拼命地磨练那本已是世所罕见的才能。　　　　　　　　　　 ５／７仅仅用了３年，她就达到了王的境界。　静静地等待着决斗开场的哈璐，她眼中映出的是这３年来的时光吗——坐在沙发上的她垂下头去，长长地叹了一口气。　『没必要太较真的。』恩力克柔声说道。　『………不用担心。　我才没较真呢。』　　　　　　　　　　 ６／７哈璐的脸上在一瞬之间似乎浮现出了忧虑般的表情，但之后在一瞬之间又恢复了一如既往的冷漠。　『我现在只是想……　看看杰克那惨败的模样。』　听到哈璐的话，恩力克暗暗发笑，似乎是确信能够在决斗中获胜一般，他的脸扭曲得更厉害了。　　　　　　　　　　　 ７／７

7356|Chapter 9 - Nostalgia    While Halle sat and contemplated her past, Jack washunched at the bar counter in the main hall. It was a spotwith a full view of the setting for the match to come. Hestared at the stage, never once even touching the drinkhe'd ordered.    The same seats, the same colors...    The more he looked at it, the more it felt as if theevents of seven years ago had happened only yesterday.     A voice started Jack from his reverie.　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 7	    'How about a drink on me?'    Without turning, he wordlessly shook his head. Jackdidn't need to look through seven-year-old memories torecognize that voice. It was Won--the very man who hadpunished King with death.    'I eagerly await seeing the level of skill that oncedethroned a king, Jack.' With that, Won disappeared.     'Heh. A jack dethroning a king, huh...?' 　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 7	    Jack could only smile bitterly.    The clock steadily ticked away.    It was 11:50.    The match would begin in ten minutes.    The guests had begun to gather in the hall. Every oneof them seemed to have been waiting eagerly for thisnight. Many had money riding on the outcome. Comparedto Enrique or Won's contest, though, they barely hadanything to lose.    Halle followed Enrique out into the hall. Taking herseat immediately, she sat quietly, eyes straight ahead.　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 7	If she was bothered by the crowd or the enormity of theevent, she gave no sign.     After watching Halle take her place, Jack slowly rosefrom his spot at the bar. Unlike Halle, Jack had a bit of aname, and as he stepped forward, the crowd called out.It brought back more memories of his match with King--how nervous and restless he was by the shouts and cheers.How he wanted nothing more than to run away.     Jack and Halle were both seated now.　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 7	    The card table in the center of the hall lay betweenthem. The two faced each other, but their gazes nevermet.     In total silence, time passed.    Shortly after the two took their seats, a black-garbedman sat in a chair across from them. Just like sevenyears ago, he was the dealer provided by Chief MinisterShamrock.    The dealer pressed a switch below the card table.Slowly, the table area sank into the floor, allowing the　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 7	guests in the hall a bird's eye view of the duel.    From behind their respective backed players, Won'sgroup and Enrique's group cast intense gazes at thegamblers' hands.    Farther back, behind it all and watching overeverything, was Chief Minister Shamrock.    'Now, then, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight, we have arevenge match!' Enrique yelled, unable to contain hisenthusiasm.    It had been far too long since the gambling world was　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 7	given such a high-stakes game. The crowd answeredEnrique's introduction with a roar of approval.         　　　　　　　　　　  7 / 7|第９回　怀旧　哈璐在恩力克的房间里待命，与此同时，杰克则坐在大厅的吧台前，从这里可以望见整个对决的舞台。　他自己点的酒一口都没碰过，只是凝视着战斗的舞台。一成不变的人物，原封未动的环境。他就这么端详着，７年前的事情宛如昨天刚刚发生过一般浮现脑海。　　　　　　　　　　　 １／７『方便的话，请我一杯怎么样？』有人在杰克背后搭话道。杰克没有回头，只是默默地把头摇了两摇。不用回想７年前发生的事，他也清楚地知道说话的人是谁，是渥恩。　渥恩在７年前赌王获胜，当然无需隐瞒，下令处死王的也正是这个男人。　　　　　　　　　　　 ２／７『超越王的杰克，你的技术…　很令我期待哦。』渥恩只说了这些，就离开了。　『超越王的杰克……吗。』杰克自嘲似的撇了撇嘴角。　分针又向前走了一步。……１１点５０分。１０分钟后对决就要开始了。　　　　　　　　　　　 ３／７观众们开始陆续向大厅集结，大家都对今晚的对决期盼已久。有很多人都在他们两人身上下了注，但是和恩力克与渥恩比起来，他们那点钱根本算不上什么。　哈璐跟着恩力克走进了大厅，然后径直走到自己的座位面前，定睛端详着前方，默不作声地坐了下来，面对观众没有显露出丝毫胆怯。　目视哈璐入座后，　　　　　　　　　　 ４／７杰克才慢慢起身。与哈璐不同，杰克作为名人受到了观众们热烈的欢呼。他也想起了７年前在这种欢呼声中不知所措的自己。　杰克与哈璐两人均已入座。牌桌占据了大厅的中央。虽然两人对面而坐，但目光却从未交汇。　一片沉默中，只有时间还在流逝。　　　　　　　　　　 ５／７　两人入座后没过多久，一名黑衣男子便来到了牌桌旁，他和７年前的时候一样，仅仅负责发牌，是夏姆洛克大佬专门为这场对决准备的。　黑衣男子打开位于牌桌下面的开关，牌桌四周随即下沉了一层，如此观众们便都能够看清决战的舞台。　杰克背后的渥恩一伙，与对面的恩力克一伙，　　　　　　　　　　 ６／７都热切地关注着两人的手边。在他们身后观望着现场的……不必说，正是夏姆洛克大佬。　『来吧，今晚就是复仇战！』面对时隔７年的决斗，难以抑制自己兴奋情绪的恩力克大叫了出来。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ７／７

10382|Chapter 10 - The Match   Separated by the small card table, the two faced off.Each player had a mountain of chips to wager. Oncesomeone's pile was reduced to nothing, the match wouldbe over.    The clock struck midnight.    In the silence following the chime, the grand matchbetween Jack and Halle began.    At first, the match was totally even. For every handJack won, Halle won another. 　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 7	    Whenever Halle won a hand, Jack had the next. Neithergave a rege. The ones most surprised by this closecontest were Won and his group. Everyone who had bet onJack started to jeer and holler.    During the match, time and again, Halle spoke to Jack.Using conversation to distract your opponent was all partof the game, but Halle's persistence went beyond justtactics.    However, Jack never said a single word back to heruntil roughly thirty minutes passed. Then, finally, hebroke the silence at the time with a low, textured voice.　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 7	    '...Once upon a time, there was a man.'    It was so soft that the crowd could barely hear,but Jack wasn't speaking for them. He continued.    'This man had somethin' he admired. He wanted tobecome the thing he admired, and he wanted to winagainst the object of his admiration...    And through it all, he was drawn closer to that whichhe admired.'     Both laid down their hands. 　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 7	    Jack had one pair. Halle had two.     Chips moved from Jack's mountain to Halle's.    'Heh. What is it, Jack? This all part of your plan?'    Halle would occasionally add a sarcastic remark, butJack just kept on telling the story.    'The man stole some tricks from that which he admiredand practiced his own skills as best he could. In the end,his efforts eventually made him strong enough that peoplecalled him 'Victory.' 　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 7	    'At some point, there was someone who took notice ofthat reputation. He thought, why not pit the best againsteach other? There's no show that could be better.'    Enrique's ears twitched. Something in what Jack wassaying bothered him.    'The man gladly accepted the offer for the show. It wasthe match of a lifetime with that which he admired most,after all.    '...The man's heart danced with excitement.

13359|Chapter 11 - The Decisive Moment    'Jack,' Halle chided, 'you're so busy talking, you'reforgetting to play the game. ...Enough. I'll settle thingshere now.'     Halle's words reignited the crowd.     The silent hall burst into excitement as she pushedforward every last chip in her pile. Perhaps she was justthat confident, but Halle already had a significant lead onJack. He couldn't possibly accept the bet...　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 8	    ...could he?    'To match my bet, since you seem a little short, howabout you wager...your life?'    Halle reached under the table and unholstered herorbal gun, then set both it and a bullet on the table byher chips. 'If I win, you can kiss your life goodbye.' The audience waited for his answer with bated breath;surely no one would be foolish enough to accept such a bet,they thought, but Jack's response was theopposite of what they were expecting...as well as　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 8	precisely what they were hoping for:    'All right. I'll call your bet. Not like it matters--if you don't kill me, someone else will.'     His response sent a wave of shock through thegambling enthusiasts in the hall, with each and every oneof them erupting into claps and unbridled cheers ofapproval.     Enrique, personally, could not have been more pleased.Won sat quietly. Whatever he thought of the situation　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 8	was privy to him and him alone.     The stakes were now that much higher, but neitherside opted to change out their cards. Rather, they choseto place their current hand face down.     'So, what happened to the man?' Halle asked, seeminglysmug with victory. Or possibly she was just asking to hearJack's final words.     '...The man never won against the one that he admired.'　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 8	   Silence followed in the wake of his response, and inthat one moment, Halle's unfailing mask shattered to pieces.Her true expression, shown at last and one so beyond heryears, was a long-unquenched rage that even Enriquehad never seen.     'What are you talking about?! You won, didn't you?!Here, in this very hall!' Tears flooded Halle's eyes andher voice buckled. 'And... And you made a fool of mypapa!' 　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 8	    Perhaps caught in the moment, Jack was as abruptand impassioned as she was. The texture in his voicethinned as he locked eyes with her and cried:    'Your father NEVER lost! Not to me. He was never madea fool, he never felt a second of misery or humiliation,he... His pride is as intact now as it was seven years ago! 'He CHOSE to lose in order to protect everything he heldso dear to him!'     Enrique, visibly panicked upon Jack's confession, sent　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 8	his thugs forward to silence Jack before he could say anymore. Won would have no such interruptions, however,and with a snap of his fingers had his own men step forwardto prevent any interference. For the first time since thematch began, his curiosity was now visibly piqued.    The crowd was restless and clamoring for the results.Once Chief Minister Shamrock gave his sign, the dealerflipped both players' cards.      Jack...had four kings.    Halle...had four jacks.　　　　　　　　　　  7 / 8	    It was well and truly Jack's victory.     The crowd immediately hushed but mouths were leftagape, and the room was bathed in a silence that wasuncomfortably palpable. All eyes were on the table and allears were perked, awaiting some kind of reaction. Secondspassed; finally, Jack was the first to speak.     '...See?' Jack muttered. 'Jack can't beat King.'  　　　　　　　　　　  8 / 8|第11回　了结之时　『杰克，你只顾闲聊，　对比赛完全不上心呢。』『……也好。　我就尽早把它结束掉吧。』　哈璐的话令鸦雀无声的大厅再度兴奋起来。也许是因为非常自信，她孤注一掷地押上了所有的筹码。不过论筹码的数量，　　　　　　　　　　 １／８哈璐早已遥遥领先。杰克没有办法接受这次挑战。　『缺少的筹码……是啊，　就用你的性命来弥补如何？』『如果我胜了这盘，你就要在这里　和自己的生命说再见了。』哈璐从短裙中取出导力枪，把它和子弹一起摆在牌桌边上。　『就算是杰克，　也没理由接受这种荒唐的提议。』　　　　　　　　　　 ２／８——人们的这种猜想随着杰克的发言化成了泡影。　『………好吧。　反正一旦我输了也是会被杀掉的。』『你的提议……我接受了。』　杰克的话令观众们为之骚然。恩力克高兴得不得了，渥恩则默不作声，只是静观着事态的发展。　双方都没有交换牌。两人将牌扣在桌上。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／８　『那么，男人最后怎么了？』大概是想听最后的遗言，因自己的胜利而沾沾自喜的哈璐向杰克问道。　『……男人一直没有能　战胜『偶像』。』　一瞬间——哈璐一直僵硬的扑克牌般的表情忽然崩碎，这时她显露出来的真实的表情　　　　　　　　　　 ４／８是连恩力克都从未见过的愤怒。　『——胡说八道！　你不是赢了吗？』『就在这个大舞台上！』『而且……而且，　你不是还让爸爸受尽耻笑了吗！！』哈璐的眼眶湿润了。　『不对！你父亲　他根本没有输。』『你的父亲完全没　　　　　　　　　　 ５／８　有感到悲惨与悔恨。』『你的父亲……王，　是为了保护重要的东西！　才主动选择了失败！』『王并没有丧失尊严！！』　听到这里，恩力克慌了手脚。他指挥部下让杰克闭嘴。但是，渥恩不允许他那样做。他控制住了恩力克的行动，请求杰克把刚才的事情说清楚。　　　　　　　　　　　 ６／８观众中也浮现出些许不安。收到夏姆洛克大佬的暗示，两名黑衣男子同时将牌翻开。　杰克是……Ｋ的铁支。哈璐是……Ｊ的铁支。　——杰克逆转获得胜利。然而满是观众的大厅仍然安静地连一根针掉在地上都能听得见。『…………知道了吗？』『杰克是赢不了王的。』　　　　　　　　　　 ７／８杰克看着牌嘟囔着。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ８／８
