43|Chapter 12 - The Truth    The charged battle had closed with Jack's dramaticupset of a victory.    Putting aside Jack's words, Won took a moment tobreathe a welcome sigh of relief, for this turn of eventswas no small victory on his part. Conversely, Enriquesat stunned, head in his hands.     Halle stared blankly at the cards.     Her eyes were wide with disbelief.　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 9	    'No way...'    'How...did you...? Four kings? That... That should beMY hand!'     Hearing this, Enrique began to violently object, leavingno excuse unaccounted for. Jack was a cheat, he insisted.The match was a wash! No--Jack was disqualified forbreaking the rules!     'Give it up, Don Enrique,' Won commanded. 'If you thinkhe's a cheat, then how about you show us, huh?　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 9	    'Go on. Show us exactly what it is Jack did.'    Won stood resolutely, arms crossed.     'Cheating's fine as long as you're not caught,' herecited.     It was a core rule of the match and Enrique knew it.There was nothing he could say back that could lay barethe trick. He stammered over his words as he rushed tonitpick every single one of Jack's actions throughout thematch, but it was no use.　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 9	    '...Impossible.'    Jack denied it all with a single word.     'This is a technique King used in his final match.I didn't know it at the time, so there's no way MisterEnrique could.'      'To make me win and to keep you safe, Halle, King usedthis very trick. Truly, a trick worthy of a king.'     Head bowed, he continued.　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 9	    '...I could never understand it. If he had a great tricklike this up his sleeve, then what on earth would make himdo somethin' dumb like throw away a match? ...I hatedhim for that, y'know. Hell, I've spent these past sevenyears consolin' myself by drownin' in booze.'     Jack looked up, his eyes catching the sparkle ofthe chandelier above them just right.     'But once I saw that invitation of yours, Halle,it started to make sense. Seeing Mister Enrique's name　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 9	on the back was all I needed for everything to fall intoplace.    'Do you remember, Halle? On the same day as thatmatch, you were in bed after being struck with a verysudden illness. No one could explain what it was.'     Jack's words had Halle like a fish on a hook.     'So what? What does that have to do with anything?'     Jack ignored her and continued.　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 9	    'Around the same time, I'd heard a certain rumorabout Mister Enrique. Word was, he'd gotten his hands ona hell of a poison. Somethin' along those lines, anyway.'     Perhaps Jack wasn't the only one who had heard thisrumor. Curious at they were to listen in on Jack's story,a flurry of whispers swept through the audience upon themention of the poison--the kind of whispers where onecouldn't understand word for word what was being said,but any onlooker would know exactly what everyonewas thinking. Enrique could only stare at the ground andbite his lip.　　　　　　　　　　  7 / 9	    The facts weren't difficult to piece together. Therewas Halle, who just so happened to fall ill during theworst of times for King. There was Enrique, who had soconveniently acquired a poison during the best of timesfor him...     '...And then there was King, who had so blatantlylost against me on purpose,' Jack listed. 'There's aneasy way to explain all those things, and it boils downto one simple truth.' 　　　　　　　　　　  8 / 9	    Won leapt to his feat, fury writ all over his features.He began screaming at Enrique.    'YOU! Seven years ago, you poisoned this girl...And then...then you threatened King with it!'      　　　　　　　　　　  9 / 9|第12回　真相　两人的决斗以杰克戏剧性地逆转获胜而告终。　暂且不提杰克的言行，总之渥恩因这场胜利而松了口气。这也与抱着头蹲在地上的恩力克形成了鲜明对比。　哈璐呆呆地看着摊开的牌，她简直无法相信眼前看到的东西。『怎么会……』　　　　　　　　　　 １／８『他到底是怎么　做到这一切的呢……』『Ｋ的铁支……　这应该是我的招式才对！』　听到这里，恩力克开始激烈抗议。杰克出了老千。这场对决无效。不对，杰克应该因为违反规则而被判负。　『别再垂死挣扎了，恩力克大人。』『既然这样你就让我看看，　　　　　　　　　　 ２／８　杰克究竟用了什么手段？』渥恩毅然质问恩力克。『出老千只要没有败露，那就没有问题。』这正是这场对决的『规则』。　虽然被如此质问，但无论有多么不甘心也没有办法反驳。恩力克为了证明杰克出了老千，开始对他的动作吹毛求疵。　『……没用的。』杰克当即否决。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／８　『这是王在　７年前曾经使用过的『招式』。』『当时的我也并不明白，　恩力克老爷也不可能明白的。』　杰克的视线转移到哈璐身上。『为了让我获胜，　哈璐，为了保护你，　王使出了这个『招式』。』『……这才是真正的『王』的招式。』　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／８杰克低下头，继续说道。　『……我一直都没明白。』『王既然拥有这种能够轻松　战胜我的招式，为什么还要　主动放弃比赛呢。』『……我一直对王感到怨恨。』『消沉下来的我在这７年来，　都只能沉湎于酒精之中，借此抚慰自己。』　『……然而到了昨天，我终于理解了。』『哈璐交给我的请柬……』　　　　　　　　　　 ５／８『在那张牌上看到恩力克老爷名字的时候……　…………我终于理清了这一切。』　『……那是在７年前决战日前后所发生的事。』『这位哈璐——王的女儿，　由于患上不明疾病而卧床不起。』　哈璐反唇相讥。『……那又怎么样？　这说明不了任何问题！』　杰克没有理会，继续说了下去。　　　　　　　　　　 ６／８『……说到７年前…………』『那时，我听说过一个　关于恩力克老爷的传闻。』『好像是说他通过某种途径　得到了一种特殊的毒药……』『是，好像确实有这么回事。』　好像有对此略知一二的人，这一阵骚动在平静的观众当中激起一片涟漪。恩力克——则咬紧了嘴唇低下头。　『哈璐为不明原因的疾病所苦。』　　　　　　　　　　 ７／８『当时围绕着恩力克老爷的传言。』『还有，故意选择了　在决战中输给我的王……』『这３件事所揭示的　……是一个再简单不过的事实。』　就在这时，渥恩突然站了起来，怒视着恩力克大吼道，『混蛋！竟敢在７年前对这个女孩下毒……』『而且……而且，　还用她要挟了王！』　　　　　　　　　　　 ８／８

3900|Chapter 13 - The Sense    'You put poisoned this girl and then threatened King,didn't you?!'     Every word from Won's mouth was akin to beingpunched in the gut, blow after blow after blow. Her bodycould only stiffen.    Before Won's accusations, Enrique desperatelyscrambled to put a defense together. He tried valiantlyto hide how flustered he was, to conceal how sweaty hispalms were, but never was there a poorer actor on a stage.　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 8	Indeed, the way he begged and pleaded his case beforesuch a massive jury was almost humorous.    Everyone was quick to believe what Jack was saying.Of course, there was no proof that such a tragedy hadoccurred at all--it could easily have been a cleverlyarranged string of lies. Yet Enrique's rambles professinghis innocence didn't make any 'sense' to them, whereasJack's story of few words made far too much.     In the underworld, betrayal was a constant companion.That was precisely why, however, plain logic trumped　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 8	proof time and time again. So long as the masses felt yourstory made the most logical sense, proof, be it present orlacking, didn't mean a damn thing.    Enrique knew this rule as well as any other man orwoman present. As it slowly dawned of him that hispunishment was only a matter of when, not if, he ceasedhis protestations.     Halle merely continued to stand as still as could be.She was being held upright by a throng of emotions, andher mind worked overtime to catch up to each new feeling　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 8	the revelations of that night had brought.     'My father never lost,' she whispered.    The truth was a comforting balm to her heart, but atthe same time, it filled her with a deep sense of loss.     Her father had chosen death himself.    The very thought of it was far too big and far too sad.    The flames of revenge that had fueled her actionssuddenly and utterly went out, and as her once burningdrive died, all that remained was thin smoke and coldwhite ash where her anger had been.　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 8	    'That means...that for me, Papa...'     The feelings that began to well up turned to words,and as they parted from her, everything that had beenbubbling up inside surged without.     Falling to the floor, Halle curled up in a ball andbegan to cry like a child.     As he glanced at Halle from the corner of his eye,Won put a hand on Jack's shoulder and patted him in acongratulatory way.　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 8	    'Tonight went better than I could have possiblyimagined. I'll do anything you ask if it's in my power,'he whispered to Jack.     'Then give me Halle,' Jack requested without amoment's hesitation.     Won was hard-pressed to answer.    No matter how pitiable he found Halle, she was still apawn of Enrique's. Even if there were to be punishmentsmeted out for the events of seven years ago, her freedom　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 8	was very much in question.     'Give Jack what he wants. Will it really be such aproblem?'     The voice from behind both of them froze every singleperson in the hall. All eyes turned to a single point.     The one who drew their gaze was the bearded consultantto the underworld: Chief Minister Shamrock. 　　　　　　　　　　  7 / 8	    'Giving him the girl isn't a problem...is it, Enrique?'     Enrique nodded weakly.    At last, the ship was filled with cries of celebration.       　　　　　　　　　　  8 / 8|第13回　情理　『你这家伙竟敢对这女孩下毒，　而且还用她要挟王！』　渥恩脱口而出的这句话，令哈璐深受打击，身体僵硬。观众之中也传出惊讶的声音。　面对渥恩的追究，恩力克一直在拼命为自己辩解。尽管他想方设法控制自己不安的情绪，但他仍然没有能够完全掩盖事实的气量。　　　　　　　　　　 １／７在同行们怀疑的目光下，他不断为自己找着借口的样子显得十分滑稽。　每个人都开始相信杰克的话了。当然，现在并没有任何证据能够证明恩力克曾在７年前向哈璐下过毒。但他的解释不合『情理』。而相比之下杰克的解释更合『情理』。　在黑社会中，背叛是家常便饭。讽刺的是，正因如此，在这个世界中『情理』——事物的合理性才会更受重视。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／７　如果遵循这条『规则』，那么证据便没有意义。恩力克也一定会受到些制裁。恩力克本人也终于想到了这一点，似乎死心一般，突然放弃了辩解。　哈璐心中五味杂陈，就那样一直呆呆地站着，一动不动。　『父亲没有输。』虽然真相让她倍感宽慰，但随之而来的就是深深的空虚感。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／７父亲为了自己而走上了不归之路。他的形象是那么高大，又是那么悲壮。　复仇的火焰支撑她走到了现在，然而如今这气势已然消逝。在闷烧之中，燃起一缕细烟，……最终就这样化为白色的灰烬。　『……怎么会，怎么会这样……　爸爸竟然为了我…………………！』涌现出的思念汇成这句话，从她口中漏出，　　　　　　　　　　 ４／７她心中的什么东西碎裂了。　哈璐摔坐到地板上，当场蜷身大哭起来。　渥恩瞥了一眼正在号泣的哈璐，然后拍了拍杰克的肩头，慰劳他几句。　『今晚真的是最棒的一晚呀，说说你的愿望吧，　只要我能办得到一定会帮助你实现的。』他低声对杰克说道。　　　　　　　　　　　 ５／７『那么就把哈璐交给我吧。』杰克毫不犹豫地答道。　渥恩不知该如何回答他是好。不管哈璐多么可怜，她终究是恩力克手上的棋子。　就算恩力克会由于７年前的所作所为受到制裁，想必他也不会轻易让哈璐获得自由的。　『就照杰克说的办。　没什么问题吧？』　　　　　　　　　　 ６／７从身后传来的声音令大厅中的所有人都毛骨悚然。所有人都把视线集中在了一点上。　视线的焦点正是那个蓄着胡子的老人，夏姆洛克大佬。　『把女孩交给他就好了吧。　…………嗯，恩力克。』　恩力克无力地点了点头。船内终于响起了庆祝胜利的欢呼声。　　　　　　　　　　 ７／７

Halle asked.    'Nothin'. You're free,' Jack shrugged nonchalantly.'I doubt anyone will ever try to use your life in anydeals ever again.

His name was Pedro.    Pedro was a small boy and not very strong,but his fingers were dexterous enough toastonish anyone. When he moved his whittlingknife, wooden blocks would turn into birds andwonderful creatures as if by magic.    The boy spent his days with these crafts ashis life.　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 4    One day, strange travelers came by thevillage. An old man with sharp eyes and a largeman in black garb casually strolled into thegeneral store whereupon their eyes were drawn toa wooden bird so cunningly carved that one couldalmost hear its wings beat the air. It wasPedro's latest creation.    After inquiring with the owner of the generalstore, the old man and his escort came upon thelittle house where Pedro lived. And the firstwords they had for him were...    'Prepare your things. We're leaving for the　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 4city!'    Pedro eyes widened in shock at the order.    'What is this?' he cried. 'Who are youpeople, any...'    His eyes fell on the large man in black.Pedro's words caught in his throat.    The old man chuckled. 'Hm. So you DIDnotice. I thought you would.'    From the old man's fingers stretchedtransparent threads. He gestured and the black-garbed man bowed gracefully.    The immense man was a clockwork puppet.　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 4    'He is the 'Black Priest,' the old man said. 'My finest work.' His wrinkled face creasedfurther as he smiled slyly.    He was the famous master Capri Oratoria, apuppeteer known throughout Weltluna.    Oratoria fixed Pedro with a beady eye. 'Youcould craft something even greater than this.Doesn't the mere thought excite you?'    No more words were needed.
