42|Chapter 2 - The Offer     The girl strode into the bar and closed the doorwithout turning a rege. There was no hesitation in hermanner; clearly, her arrival was not happenstance. Herface was determined, but her confident entrance couldn'terase the lingering innocence of youth--even the best liarwouldn't try and claim she was more than eighteen. Darkbrown eyes and hair suggested she was Eastern, but hernose and features made it hard to be sure.     The girl slowly walked forward.　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 7	    With each step, her cute little knees peeked out fromunder the trim cut of her skirt. Her outfit was a designwithout any sense of decoration. It seemed her taste laymore along the lines of utility than style.    Maybe because of that, the Eastern symbol necklace onher chest couldn't help but look equally unremarkable. ...The lack of volume in that area probably had somethingto do with that as well. It would still be some timebefore she really 'bloomed,' so to speak.    An appearance bearing the signs of East and West both,and simple, unembellished clothes... The girl might havebeen the spirit of the Eastern Quarter made flesh.　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 7	    She caught the eye of one of the punks hanging aboutalmost instantly.    'Heh. Hey, little girly,' he slurred. 'Wanna have somefun with me?'    As he spoke, he grabbed the girl's wrist with onegreasy hand.     It happened in an instant.     Her arm flew up, dislodging the punk's grip. Now freed, her hand disappeared deep into her skirt and　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 7	then slid out with a mass of gleaming black iron.     She pressed it to the space between his eyes. He staredat the object for a moment before collapsing to his kneesin fear.    It was an orbal gun of cunning make--a high-caliberVerne Company model. If she'd shot that firearm, the punkwould have lost his head instead of his bladder. Needlessto say, it was not your average self-defense weapon.     'It's the latest model,' she purred. 'Want to see whatit can do?'　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 7	    She was cool and calm, the barrel of the gun neverwavering. Were she to fire, her aim would be perfect.    Overwhelmed by the girl, gun, or perhaps both, thepunk couldn't move a muscle. Everyone else in the barremained frozen as well. All eyes were on the girl.     '*hic* ...Hey, miss. Hate to ask, but could ya let himoff with that?'     Maybe the speaker couldn't stand it anymore or maybeit was disturbing his drink, but the husky, sensual voicebroke through the silence.　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 7	    It was Jack.    Still planted firmly in his chair, breath smelling ofliquor, he continued.     'I'm sure he's very sorry, and he's learned his lesson.'    As if in answer to it, the punk started nodding his headvigorously.    'I've come here to gamble,' the girl replied abruptly.She slowly lowered the gun in her left hand, herexpression continuing to remain cool and detached.     'Sounds good. C'mon over here. Gimme everythin' you　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 7	got.'     Jack's words had an immediate impact, not on the girlbut on the gathered goons and hoods. They all shared aglance, each and every one of them, with the dirtiest grinyou could imagine.      　　　　　　　　　　  7 / 7|第２回　引诱　少女走进店里，顺势反手把门关上。看来并不是进错了店的样子。　她的表情还残存着一丝无邪的纯真……不管怎么说应该都不会超过１８岁。其实可能只有１５、６岁才对。从暗褐色的瞳仁和头发来看应该是东方血统，但那高高的鼻梁又让人不能断言。　少女慢慢走了过来。　　　　　　　　　　 １／７她每迈出一步，那小巧可爱的膝盖都会从裙子的下摆之中显露出来。完全没有一丝修饰的装束……看来和外观比起来她更注重的是运动的便利性吧。　大概也是由于这个原因，她胸前东方风格的垂饰看来也就是索然无味的手工艺品。……发育还不成熟也是原因之一吧。想要穿出那种性感的魅力来怕是还得花上一段时间。　　　　　　　　　　　 ２／７兼具东西方特征的这幅容貌再加上毫无修饰的素朴的服饰——少女简直就是这条东方人街的化身。　有一个小流氓立刻盯上了少女。『嘿嘿、小姐。　……不和我干点好事儿吗？』小流氓一说完，马上用油光发亮的手一把抓住了少女的手腕。　——瞬间。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／７少女一把甩掉了小流氓的胳膊，然后把重获自由的手伸进裙子中，顺手掏出了一件乌黑发亮的铁器。　小流氓一看到抵着自己鼻尖的东西，吓得一屁股坐在了地板上。　共和国乌尔努社制导力枪。这种武器以体积小，却拥有大口径而著称。如果就这样开火的话，小流氓的脑袋会被轰飞的吧。……这可不是一般少女防身带的东西。　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／７『最新型的哦，要不要试一下？』少女似乎已经习惯了这种状况，表现地异常冷静。手中导力枪的枪口纹丝不动。小流氓似乎也被少女的这种气势所压倒，僵在那里，一动也不敢动。　酒馆里的空气完全凝固住了。周围的视线全部集中在少女身上。　『唔～嗝……小姐。　就这样吧，放他一马怎么样。』　　　　　　　　　　 ５／７也许是实在看不下去了，突然有人说道。嘶哑却又略带磁性的声音。——是杰克。　他就那样坐在椅子上，吐出一口酒气，继续说道。『这家伙应该也好好反省过了。』他这么说完又望向小流氓。小流氓也就像回应他一般拼命地点着头。　　　　　　　　　　　 ６／７『我是过来玩牌的。』少女硬生生地丢下了这句话，同时缓缓放下了左手握着的导力枪，表情仍然是一脸冷漠。　『……好啊，过来这边吧。　让我来当你的对手。』　对杰克的话产生反应的并不是少女，而是那些小流氓们。他们面面相觑了一阵，脸上都浮现出了猥琐的笑容。　　　　　　　　　　 ７／７

3411|Chapter 3 - Challenge at High Noon     Jack and the girl moved over to a table inthe back. Unlike the other pitted and stickyfurniture, this table was smooth and polished toa shine and seemed meant for gambling. Without aword, both took their seats. Jack sat againstthe wall, and the girl faced him straight on.    The other patrons were captivated.Helplessly fascinated by the match, they snuckglances at the pair, ears straining to listenin.　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 8	    The bar filled with fidgety silence.     The girl's game of choice was poker.    Jack accepted wordlessly.     After a brief exchange to confirm the terms of thechallenge, they settled on bets. It was to be 100 mira ahand--not even enough to buy a beer--but Jack consideredthat fair for a match against a kid and said as much.     The dealer was the small-fry punk from before. Jackgave him a quick eye signal. 　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 8	    First hand:    Both discarded just one card.     Jack called and the girl stood.    Jack had two pairs.     The girl had just one. Jack was the winner.     'Haha. Sorry, little missy,' he drawled.    He raised his glass to her and downed the amber liquidin a single, decisive gulp.　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 8	    Second hand:    Both discarded just one card.    Perhaps trying to look confident, Jack let out a big,clear sigh.     The girl called and Jack stood.     The girl had two pairs. Jack had the same. But thecards told the tale...     The girl's hand had the high card.　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 8	    It was her win.     '...What?!' Jack exclaimed.    His hand that had been toying with the glass froze.Immediately, he glanced over at the punk who was dealing.The other man avoided his gaze.     'Something wrong?' the girl asked.    Her face betrayed nothing.     'N-No... Forget it,' he shakily responded.　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 8	    Had she swapped out some cards? The game had suddenly taken on a whole new angle.     The look on Jack's face changed instantly.     Lightly clearing his throat, Jack put the glass back onthe table with his left hand. Then, once more, he clearedhis throat. The dealer, recognizing the signal, picked upthe cards again. It was their code for 'Deal normally nextround.' 　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 8	    Third hand:    As expected, each discarded just one card.     Jack called and the girl stood.    Jack's hand was...a full house.     'Hahaha! How 'bout THAT?!' he crowed.    With a flourish, Jack laid his cards on the table. Thebar patrons snickered into their cups.     The girl set down her own cards without a word.　　　　　　　　　　  7 / 8	...Four sevens.     It was the girl's win.    The bar once again returned to silence.       　　　　　　　　　　  8 / 8|第３回　正午的决战　杰克与少女一同走向里面的桌位。那里用清漆精心擦亮，可能就是玩牌专用的地方。两人默不作声地入座，杰克背靠着墙，少女则与他相对而坐。　小流氓们偷偷地观察着两个人，看来十分在意他们之间的胜负。大家毫无例外地侧耳细听着，整个酒馆之中弥漫着令人不安的沉默。　　　　　　　　　　 １／７　少女向杰克提出以梭哈一决胜负，而杰克默然接受了挑战。利用两三句暗号确认了规则之后，最后决定了下注的金额。每局１００米拉——这点钱连买酒都不够。『对手毕竟是小孩，这样就够了。』杰克单方面做了决定。　由刚才那个小流氓负责发牌，杰克则微微地向他使了个眼色。　　　　　　　　　　　 ２／７第一回合——双方都只交换了一次牌。杰克要求开牌。少女同意了。杰克两对。少女一对。——杰克赢下这一盘。『哈哈，不好意思啊小姐。』他将满满一杯的琥珀色的液体一饮而尽。　第二回合——　　　　　　　　　　 ３／７双方都只交换了一次牌。也许是表示赢得很轻松，杰克打了一个大大的哈欠。少女要求开牌。杰克同意了。少女两对。杰克两对。比较牌面的大小……则是少女的牌比较强。——少女赢下这一盘。　『……………什么！？』杰克正在玩弄酒杯的手猛然停了下来。　　　　　　　　　　 ４／７杰克马上瞪了小流氓一眼。对方赶忙把眼神移开。　『怎么了？』少女问道，她就像扑克脸一样面无表情。　『不，不……没什么。』（难道这家伙在出老千？　……………………有意思。）　——杰克的眼神变了。　　　　　　　　　　 ５／７他轻轻咳嗽了一声，把左手上的杯子放回桌上，然后又咳嗽了一声。……听到暗示的小流氓将牌放入手中。那是在说『这回要正常地发牌』。　第三回合——双方还是都只交换了一次牌。杰克要求开牌。少女同意了。杰克手中的是……葫芦。『哈哈哈，如何！』　　　　　　　　　　 ６／７杰克满脸得意地翻开手牌。小流氓之中也有人开始窃笑。　少女漫不经心地翻开自己的手牌。……７的铁支。　　结果少女获得了胜利——酒馆中顿时鸦雀无声。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ７／７

6278|Chapter 4 - The Daughter     Ultimately...it was the girl's win.     The silence in the bar was punctuated only by the sounds of a raucous argument out on the street.    'Heh heh... Hahaha...'     Holding back the laughter bubbling up, Jack asked thegirl a question.    'Hey, missy...where, oh, where, did you learn to be　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 6	this good?'     The girl made no reply.     Instead, she took the cards into her hands and beganshuffling. They flew back and forth with exquisite gracebetween her long, slender fingers.     She dealt five to Jack, then five to herself.    'Show them,' she demanded, and Jack obliged,hesitantly turning over the cards.　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 6	    His hand was four jacks.    Her hand was four kings.   'You're... You're kidding me!'   Jack was nearly speechless by the sight, to    which she only said: 'Jack doesn't beat King.'    At the word 'King,' murmurs rippled through the bar.    'King.' It was the handle of a legendary gambler, saidto be the best in the Republic until his death. The cardtechnique the girl had shown was one of the ones the Kinghad been fond of using when he felt like teasing Jack.　　　　　　　　　　  3 / 6	    'Who...? Just who are you?' Jack asked the girl. Shegave him a long, bitterly-cold glare at the question, as ifit were both stupid and one she'd been dying to answer.    'You probably don't know me, but I know you VERY well,'she spat. 'Hello, Victory Jack. My name is Halle. I'm thedaughter of King, who you killed.'     '...You're King's daughter?!'    Jack had never met King's daughter--not in person, no.But nonetheless, he did have memories of her. King hadbeen a doting father that had drilled holes in Jack's ears　　　　　　　　　　  4 / 6	with endless stories about her.    'I see... So King's daughter has come to kill me, huh?'    The atmosphere in the bar was suddenly charged.     'All right, then. Kill me.'     The words casually left Jack's mouth.     It was a line no one in the bar had ever expected.    He tapped his chest. 　　　　　　　　　　  5 / 6	    'The heart's here. Make sure you aim well.'    The girl--Halle--quietly drew her orbal gun. Her aim,of course...was Jack's heart.        　　　　　　　　　　  6 / 6|第４回　女儿　结果……少女获胜。街道上传来的喧嚣，掠过了一片寂静的酒馆。　『呵呵……呵呵呵………』杰克强忍笑意向少女问道，『我说小姐，你到底是从哪儿　学来这手艺的？』　少女没有回答。　　　　　　　　　　 １／６不过她将牌拿在手中，开始用精湛的技巧洗起了牌。然后将牌如同自然滑落一般交替地发给自己手边５张，杰克那边也是５张。　『翻开吧。』少女说。杰克揭开牌。杰克手中的是Ｊ的铁支，少女手中的则是Ｋ的铁支。　『这……这种发牌技巧是………！』看到牌面之后的杰克一时语塞。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／６　『杰克是赢不了王的。』他脑中回响着『王』这个词。　『王』，是曾被誉为共和国最强的已故传奇赌博师的称号。少女刚刚展示的手法正是王最擅长的技术——是他以前戏耍杰克时常用的发牌技巧。　『你到底是……何方神圣？』　　　　　　　　　　 ３／６杰克深吸一口气，向少女问道。　这次少女终于回答了杰克的提问。『你可能并不知道　我究竟是什么人，　但我对你可是了如指掌。』『你好。　常胜杰克。』『我的名字叫哈璐。　是被你杀死的王的女儿哦。』　『………！　你说你是王的女儿！？』　　　　　　　　　　 ４／６他从没有和王的女儿直接见过面。但是，杰克的确对她有印象。因为爱女如命的王总是在他面前提起他的女儿，听得杰克耳朵都快生茧了。　『原来如此……王的女儿　过来取我性命的吗………』酒馆里流动着紧张的气氛。　『好啊，杀了我吧。』杰克不假思索地脱口而出。　　　　　　　　　　 ５／６酒馆里没有人料到他真的会说出这种话。　『心脏在这儿，你可得好好瞄准啊。』他一边说着，一边敲着自己的胸口给少女看。　少女——哈璐默默地举起导力枪，瞄准的自然是……杰克的心脏。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ６／６

The punks and hoods just cowered,whispering from their seats.    'SHUT UP, all'a ya!' Jack shouted over the buzz.    The chatter in the bar stilled.    Grinding his back teeth, Jack looked straight into thegirl's eyes.    '...That's right. My goal is revenge,' she seethed,　　　　　　　　　　  1 / 5	'But...it won't mean anything like this.'     Halle lowered her gun.     As Jack watched the barrel of the weapon slide awayfrom his chest, confusion creased his face.    Halle continued talking.    'Over these last three years, I've spent blood,sweat, and tears to learn to be as good as I am.'    With that, the girl threw a card in Jack's face.It was some kind of invitation.　　　　　　　　　　  2 / 5	   'I have a stage that's better suited to settling this allready for us,' she said, never giving Jack a momentto protest. 'We'll finish our match there. It'll be oneof the poker matches you love oh-so dearly. And Iswear, I'll make sure you eat your full share ofmisery and bitterness after the slop you forced myfather to swallow.'    With her threat lingering in the air, Halle disappeared.    Unable to grasp the meaning in the girl's words, Jackjust sat there for a while.
