41|Chapter 3 - On the Road Home     Pedro visited the city accompanied by theBlue Knight. With the crowning ceremonyapproaching, the streets were abuzz withexcitement. As he strolled the city center,people passing by cast strange looks his way.    'What a noble knight he must be.'    'I'm sure he must be quite the famous hero.'    'Do you suppose he's attending the crowningceremony?'    Trailing quietly behind the Blue Knight,　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 3Pedro could hardly keep himself from doing alittle dance. It felt like a step towards Capri,who could control the Black Priest as if it washuman itself. Of course, at the same time hefound it annoying that others thought him theservant of his own creation.     It was on his way back to the workshopoutside of town that Pedro's humming wasinterrupted by a scream.    'No... Please, stop!' cried a voice fromthe woods.　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 3    'Heh heh, no one's gonna save you!' a mangrowled. 'Give up and give in!'     From the looks of things, some thuggish menhad a girl cornered.    Dainty and clad in a white dress, the girl'ssearching eyes sought desperately for a way toflee from the danger.    Pedro squared his shoulders, and loweringhis cap to shadow his eyes, he set his fingersin motion. The Blue Knight charged forward. 　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 3|第３话　王都归途　佩德罗带着『苍骑士』来到了王都。因为加冕仪式在即，街上忽然间充满了活力。路上的行人纷纷把好奇的目光投向了他们。　『真是位了不起的骑士大人啊』『想必是位有名的英雄吧』『是过来出席加冕仪式的吗？』　装作一本正经的表情，走在苍骑士身后的佩德罗不禁要手舞足蹈起来。　　　　　　　　　　 １／３这是因为他感觉离能将『黑法师』操纵得如同真人一般的卡普利又近了一步。话虽如此，自己被当作随从可真是没什么意思。　佩德罗哼着小曲，走在返回郊外人偶工房的路上。『不要……请住手！』从树丛之间传来了惊叫声。　『嘿嘿，怎么会有人来救你！』『死心吧，给我老实一点！』　　　　　　　　　　 ２／３看起来像是小流氓的几个男子正把一个女孩子摁在地上。　穿着雪白连衣裙的纤巧身躯为了脱离束缚而拼命挣扎着。佩德罗将帽子压低到眼眉，舞动指尖让『苍骑士』奔跑起来。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ３／３

1422|Chapter 4 - A Righteous Display     Upon seeing the Blue Knight appear like ashadow from the heart of the forest, the menharassing the girl could only gape in amazement.    'Leave the girl, and leave this place,' theBlue Knight declared from the depths of itshelmet.    This was the ventriloquism that the oldmaster had drilled into his head as a secret ofpuppeteering.    'Who the... Who the hell're you? Get outta　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 3here before ya get hurt!'    'Fools...'    With a jab from its clockwork fist, the BlueKnight knocked back the man holding the womanand pivoted swiftly to kick both men away.     'Are you hurt, young lady?'    'N-No, I am well.'    'Good. 'Twould be best if you stood back.'    At last, the Blue Knight drew its sword.     Swathed in black, a third man who seemed　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 3like the leader approached.    'Not bad for a wanderer...'    Pedro eyed the new arrival. The black-garbedman's stance suggested he knew something ofproper swordsmanship.    'Enough playing, though. Hand over the girland I'll see you rewarded.'    'To ignore one's duties is to be withoutcourage. I fear I cannot do that,' said theBlue Knight.    'Well, then...DIE!' screamed the black-garbedman and attacked.　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 3|第４话　见义勇为　从森林深处如影子般突然现身的苍骑士令那些正在袭击女孩子的男子们目瞪口呆。　『放下那女孩，赶快离开』苍骑士从头盔中发出警告。这是人偶师的奥义之一，由老师传授的腹语术。　『什么……你算什么东西？』『趁着还没受伤，赶紧滚！』　　　　　　　　　　 １／３　『真愚蠢……』苍骑士踏前一步，拉近距离。一记正拳将抓着女孩子不放的男子打昏在地，回头又踢飞了另外两人。　『没有受伤吧，小姐？』『没、没有。我没事』『那就好。你快离开这里吧』苍骑士总算拔出了剑。　身着黑衣，首领模样的男子走了过来。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／３『是异乡人吗，身手不错啊……』从这个黑衣男子摆出的架势中也可以看出他似乎对正规剑术颇有心得。『不过，游戏到此为止。　我会给你些钱的，把女孩交给我』　『见义不为，无勇也。　恕在下不能接受』　『那么……去死吧！！』伴随着锐利的气势，黑衣男子发起了攻击。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／３

2752|Chapter 5 - The Girl With Sky Blue Eyes     The man in black attacked.    From the upper-right, he feinted as if tostrike the shoulder, but twisted his wrist andchanged to a slash across the body.    Pedro, having read the feint, pulled at hisstrings.     The Blue Knight stepped back a half step,dodging the horizontal slash, then smacked theoutstretched blade, knocking it from his foe'shands.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    'I-Impossible...'    The black-garbed man rubbed his numb handand paled as the Blue Knight shifted slightly.    As if it was a sign, the thugs turned andscattered like baby spiders.    The girl gave a sigh of relief and curtsied.    'Thank you very much...'    She was still a bit shaky, but her mannerwas that of a noble woman.    'It is the duty of every knight to protect.Pay it no mind.'    'Ah, are you from foreign lands, perhaps?'　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4    Suddenly Pedro was struck with a moment ofwhimsy.    'I am the touring knight, Pedro. The boythere is my servant,' he made the puppet reply.    'Huh...?'    The girl finally seemed to notice him. Shefaced him with an expression of bewilderment.    However...    Pedro was no less surprised. Indeed, hisshock was many, many times greater than hers.    Cool, turquoise-blue eyes.    That familiar, achingly lovely form.　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4    It was the same girl he had seen atceremonies and from the balcony of the palace.     'Y-Your Highness?' he blurted.     The girl wrapped in pure white was the verygirl who had just lost her father and was to becrowned in the capital.     It was Princess Tia.  　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第５话　天蓝瞳眸的少女　黑衣男子发起了攻击。他佯装从右上方斜斩下来，然后一翻手腕，朝着身体横扫过来。　佩德罗看穿了他的佯攻，牵引着丝线。苍骑士后退了半步，避开了横斩，将对方挥空的刀刃打落在地。　『不、不可能……』黑衣男子脸色苍白，握着麻木的手臂。　　　　　　　　　　 １／４见到这番场景，小流氓们当下四散奔逃。　『非常感谢……』女孩子安下心来，喘着气向苍骑士道谢。看来应该是一位礼仪端正的良家女子。　『这是骑士的义务。请不要在意』『请问，您是外国人吗？』佩德罗突然心血来潮想要开个玩笑。『我是游历骑士佩德罗。　顺带一提，这位少年是我的随从』　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４　『咦……』女孩子好像刚刚才察觉到佩德罗的存在，以一副不知所措的表情望着他。　不过……佩德罗同样吃了一惊。不，他比女孩子还要吃惊十倍。绿松石般青蓝透彻的瞳眸。从正面看去那惹人怜爱的身姿，与祭典时在王宫露台上见到的一模一样。　　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４『公、公主殿下？』一袭白衣的女孩子正是父王甫逝，行将加冕的缇雅公主殿下。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

4457|Chapter 6 - The Melancholy of the Princess     'Would you be willing to guard me for thesetwo weeks until the crowning ceremony?'    In the royal throne room Princess Tia askedthis question with a serious expression. Ofcourse, she asked it not of Pedro, but of theBlue Knight.    'Have you not a royal guard? Surely youwould be far better off with them as yourprotectors.'    Unable to say that the Blue Knight was a　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4puppet, Pedro followed as far as the throneroom. He shivered, sensing even more troubleabout to come.    'The royal guard that protect the capitalare... They obey the words of my uncle, DukeGaston. Even before, they abandoned me andfled,' Princess Tia said softly.    Duke Gaston was a man surrounded by badrumors. It was an open secret that he tookadvantage of the previous king's illness toline his own purse.    'The man in black you confronted, Sir　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4Pedro, I am sure that was my uncle's second-in-command. All of it was planned...'    Princess Tia's sky-blue eyes clouded.     At this point, the kindly Pedro could hardlyrefuse the role of escort.    'Understood. I shall accept your request,'he had the Blue Knight reply.     Princess Tia's smile was like the sunbreaking through the clouds. 'Thank you, sirknight... Thank you so very much.'　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    She turned towards Pedro as well.    'And you too, good servant. May I ask foryour name?'     'I...'     Pedro hid his eyes once more in the shadowof his cap.    'I'm no one worthy of naming myself.'  　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第６话　公主的忧郁　『在加冕仪式结束前的这两周里，　你能够保护我吗？』　在王宫的谒见大厅。缇雅公主认真地提出了请求。当然不是对佩德罗，而是对苍骑士。　『不必委托在下这种人吧，　不是还有禁卫骑士吗？』还没有机会说出苍骑士是人偶，　　　　　　　　　　 １／４就一直跟到了王宫的佩德罗预感到会被卷入更麻烦的事件中，不由得打了个冷战。　『保卫王都的禁卫骑士团……　对我的叔父，加斯顿公爵唯命是从。　刚才也是丢下我不管，擅自离开了』　加斯顿公爵是个恶评如潮的人物。他趁着前国王重病缠身之时中饱私囊，已是众人皆知的秘密。　『与佩德罗大人交战的黑衣男子，　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４　一定是叔父的副官。　这一切都是设计好的吧……』缇雅公主天蓝色的眼眸蒙上了一层阴霾。　事到如今，心地善良的佩德罗实在无法拒绝护卫任务。『明白了。在下接受您的请求』　『太好了……非常感谢』公主脸上浮现出了愉快的笑容。安下心来，公主将隐约染上一层玫瑰色的脸庞转向伪装成随从的佩德罗。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４　『随从先生，也要请您多关照了。　请问您如何称呼？』『区、区区贱名不值一提』佩德罗再度将帽子压低到眼眉。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

6105|Chapter 7 - Turbulent Days     Protecting the princess proved harder thanpredicted. After all, almost every day therewere new ne'er-do-wells sent after her.    Eventually, partially due to their closenessin age, Princess Tia and Pedro, still playingthe servant, came to speak very openly to eachother.    While glad for the princess' trust, hedidn't know what he would do if the truth of theBlue Knight came out.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 3    Pedro was beside himself with worry.     On the other side of the city, a letter wasdelivered to a certain puppet workshop.     'What is that boy doing...'    Guessing the circumstances from the veryvague statements in Pedro's letter, Capri sighedand gave a bitter smile.     'However, perhaps this is a good chance,'he mused.　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 3    Pedro was ever bright, and straight as anarrow, yet his thoughts were always of puppets.Partially due to living outside the city, he hadno friends he could call close, and yet ithardly seemed as if he felt lonely for it.     While the role of escort to the princess wasperhaps beyond his station, if it proved achance to awaken more human feelings in hisapprentice, Capri could only wish him the bestwith a parent's heart. 　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 3|第７话　平稳的每日　公主的护卫工作，比想象中还要辛苦。毕竟几乎每天都要和图谋不轨的恶人打交道。　在这段时间里，也许是因为年龄相仿，缇雅公主对伪装成随从的佩德罗也逐渐亲近起来。　虽然公主的信赖令他高兴，然而如果苍骑士的真实面目被识破了又会如何呢，　　　　　　　　　　 １／３佩德罗整天都在提心吊胆。　另一方面，郊外的人偶工房也收到了佩德罗的传信。　『在干什么啊，那家伙……』从表述模糊的字里行间中，卡普利还是推断出了大约的状况，他苦笑着叹了口气。　『不过，说不定是个好机会呢』佩德罗天性开朗率直，　　　　　　　　　　 ２／３但是却一门心思只惦记着人偶。他虽然住在郊外，又没有亲密的好友，但是却一点也不觉得寂寞。　担任公主殿下的护卫虽说实在是不敢当，但是趁此机会，或许他也能学到些人情世故，卡普利真诚地期望着。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ３／３
