He felt nota moment of sympathy or care for his niece.    'At this rate she shall see the crowningceremony!' he snarled. 'This knight, Pedro,can't we handle him?'    'He's the first man so skilled that we'veencountered. We fear that even if the royalguard attacked at once it might be difficult...'　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    Recalling the shame of having his swordknocked from his hands, Duke Gaston's second-in-command bit his lip.    'Still, we have nothing to fear,' he said. 'While a bit of an odd character, we have hired a skilled assassin to handle this, my lord.'    'Odd? What sort of person is he?'     '...Ahaha, did you call?'    The flames danced bewitchingly, then wentout as one. As if something tremendously heavyhad collapsed down onto it, the carpeted floor　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4shook with a thud.    'Wh-Who is it?'    Duke Gaston took a step back.    The shadow illuminated by the moon wastremendous...and inhuman.     'My lord, fear not. This is our assassin,Harlequin. He will remove all that is in yourway with his puppet.'    The assassin sketched a mocking bow.    'Ahaha, I do love hunting. I don't take jobsunless the prey's lively.'　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    A sickening laugh shook the darkness,bringing a nasty smile to the duke's face aswell.     'Worry not. I am sure your hunt will be MOSTenjoyable.'     And so did the night bathed in red by acrimson moon fade to dawn, melting like ice.   　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第８话　震慑黑暗之人　『这丫头竟然这么走运！』　在烛光摇曳的昏暗房间里，加斯顿公爵懊恼地大骂着，其中完全感受不到叔侄间的亲情。　『怎么能就这样让她加冕呢！　那个叫佩德罗的骑士，就没有办法解决掉吗？』『我还是第一次见到这等高手。　就算禁卫骑士团以多打少，恐怕也很难……』　　　　　　　　　　 １／４回想起剑被打落的屈辱，加斯顿公爵的副官咬紧了嘴唇。　『不过，请您放心。　我已经雇到了强大的暗杀者，　虽说有些与众不同』『与众不同的暗杀者。究竟是何许人也？』　『……哈哈哈，您叫我吗？』火焰华丽地舞动起来，旋即消失。有什么奇重无比的东西飞落下来，震得铺着地毯的地板都摇晃了几下。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４　『什、什么人！？』加斯顿公爵大惊失色，向后退去。月光下浮现出的巨大轮廓，绝不可能属于普通的人类。　『阁下，请您放心。　这就我所说的暗杀者，名为哈雷克因。　似乎是使用傀儡完成任务的』　『哈哈哈，我最喜欢狩猎了。　不是活生生的猎物的话，我可看不上眼哦』　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４病态的狂笑在黑暗中回荡，公爵也再度露出了邪恶的笑容。　『放心吧。　这一定会是一场快乐的狩猎』被月光染成绯红色的天空似乎溶化殆尽，夜深了。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

1743|Chapter 9 - Afternoon in the Lesser Palace     Afternoon in the palace began with a teaparty in the gardens. The princess, as always,filled three cups with black tea from the pot.    'Please, enjoy your tea.'    'My thanks,' the Blue Knight intoned.    'Thank you very much,' Pedro said.    Pedro moved the Blue Knight with his lefthand as he sipped the tea made by the princess.It was the happiest moment in their otherwisebusy days.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    'Good servant, you really seem to enjoy yourtea. It makes it very worth the effort for theone who made it.'     'Haha... You are too kind.'    Smiling bitterly, Pedro pulled his strings.    The Blue Knight, in one go, emptied the teain the cup into the leather sack in his neck.     At this, Princess Tia could only sigh.    'Whereas Sir Pedro here seems to hardly findit delicious at all. It makes it difficult to be　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4motivated...'     'Pardon me. I fear I am an impolite man.'    In his heart, Pedro felt a nervous edge, butthe Blue Knight answered with an ever calm face.     There had been countless moments where itseemed as if everything would be revealed, butPrincess Tia showed no signs of doubting thetruth of the Blue Knight.     The princess smiled faintly, but her　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4expression quickly turned somber.     'I suppose it doesn't matter. These funafternoons will end tomorrow. After the crowningceremony the following day, you shall both leavethe city, after all...'      　　　　　　　　　　4 / 4|第９话　王宫的午后　王宫的午后，是从中庭的茶会开始的。公主同平时一样拿起茶壶向三只杯子中斟满红茶。　『来，请慢用』『不胜感激』『不客气了』佩德罗一边用左手操纵着苍骑士的动作，一边啜饮着公主沏的红茶。这是繁忙的一天中最为幸福的时光。　　　　　　　　　　 １／４　『随从先生，看您的样子　似乎觉得很好喝呢。　这样我泡茶也值得了』　『哈哈……不胜惶恐』佩德罗一边苦笑着，一边牵动丝线，将沏好的红茶一口气倒进装在苍骑士咽喉处的皮袋中。　缇雅公主轻轻叹了口气。『相比之下佩德罗先生，　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４　好像一点也不觉得好喝的样子。　真是没劲啊……』　『实在丢脸。在下不懂得吃喝』佩德罗心里一惊，但马上摆出一本正经的表情让苍骑士答道。　到现在为止，像这种几乎暴露身份的情况已经出现过很多次了，但缇雅公主却对苍骑士的身份丝毫都没有怀疑。　公主突然一脸孤寂地低下了头。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４『这么快乐的午后，明天以后也就不再有了。　后天的加冕仪式结束之后，　两位就要离开王都了吧……』　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

I shall hardly makemuch of a queen like this.'    The princess shook herself and smiledbrightly.    Forgetting to control the puppet, Pedro　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4ducked his head to hide the longing on his face.He would have loved to stay as her guard.    Though she might have been of noble birth,Princess Tia was a lonely girl who had lost herfather.    However, she had been speaking not of theservant-like Pedro but of the Blue Knight. Tothe princess, Pedro was simply part of thepackage.    Thinking that made his chest hurt somehow.It was a pain such as he'd never felt when hewas handling his puppets.　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4    Ultimately, Pedro had chosen.    Even if it meant saddening the princess, toflee from this unbearable pain in his chest...    'Ah, would you like a second cup?'    As if to clear the heavy atmosphere, theprincess offered the pot with a smile.     'Oooh, that DOES sound good, mind giving mea cup?'    With an unnerving laugh, a shadow leapt in.    'Ah...'    'What?!'　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    A sudden gust tore through the garden,sending the tea set flying off the table.Crimson wings beat the air as an immense puppetin the form of a devil fell to the earth.     'Sorry for interrupting your lovely teaparty,' tittered a voice. 'Would you mindplaying with me for a bit?'    On the devil's left arm was a human figure.It was the masked puppeteer, Harlequin.    'I'll make sure it's plenty of fun,' hegiggled.　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第１０话　微弱的苦痛　公主那寂寞的腔调令佩德罗一阵心跳。　『武者修行之身……实在抱歉』『哪里，应该道歉的是我才对。　在意这种小事，可当不了出色的女王啊』公主莞然一笑。佩德罗甚至忘记了继续操纵人偶，自己低下了头。　他多么想一直作为护卫陪伴在公主左右。　　　　　　　　　　 １／４无论身份多么高贵，缇雅公主也是个刚刚失去父亲的孤独的女孩。这一点是不会改变的。　然而，她所依赖的是苍骑士，并不是装作随从的佩德罗。对公主而言，佩德罗只不过是个附属而已。　这样一想，不知为何心中一阵苦痛。这种感觉，在以前制作人偶的时候是从来没有体会过的。最后，佩德罗做出了选择。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４就算要令公主伤心，也要逃避开这难以忍受的痛苦……　『对了，再来一杯如何？』似乎为了缓和沉重的气氛，公主微笑着说道。　『不错啊，也请我喝一杯吧？』伴随着令人毛骨悚然的笑声，一道黑影飞掠而来。　『啊…』『什么！？』　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４突如其来的狂风横扫过中庭，将茶具吹得四散。随风而至的是扇动着红色双翼的外形仿佛恶魔一般的巨大人偶。　『优雅的茶会虽然不错。　不过也陪我玩玩吧？』恶魔的左臂上有一个人影。他就是蒙面人偶师，哈雷克因。　『我会让你们好好快活一下的』　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

5112|Chapter 11 - The Devil's Attack     'Lady Tia, stand back!'    Pedro, shielding the princess behind him,sent the Blue Knight forward towards the crimsondevil's right arm. It was a blind spot for themasked puppeteer.    With a rapid turn, the knight let loose aheavy strike. The tip of the sword was swallowedup in the base of the creature's wing. Thedemon's right arm flashed up. Blade and clawscraped, sending sparks into the air.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    Losing its balance, the Blue Knight took anunsteady step back. The demon gave a shiver, anda barbed tail thick as a log screamed throughthe air, striking forward.     Astonished by the technique, Pedro snappedthe Blue Knight back, dodging the tail swipe.     'Oh, you ARE good. I didn't think you werein the same business.'    The masked puppeteer spoke not to the BlueKnight but to Pedro.　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4     The Blue Knight, as if to interrupt thesewords, pointed its sword at the puppeteer.    'What nonsense are you speaking! If youshall not come, than shall I strike first?'    Even now, Pedro tried to hide it.    Princess Tia, with a confused expression,gazed upon the proceeding events.     'I seeeee. So that's how it is...'    The masked puppeteer, as if suddenlyrealizing the situation, laughed softly.　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    'My, my. Well, let no one call me rude. Ifyou'd rather not share, I'll stay quiet. But youknow...'     The puppeteer's voice dipped low and wastinged with a roiling darkness.     'If you don't even have that much guts,then even thinking you can win against myCalamity is NAIVEEEEEEEEE!!!'  　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第１１话　魔人袭来　『缇雅公主，快退后！』佩德罗将公主护在身后，一边操纵着苍骑士奔向红色恶魔的右侧。那里是蒙面人偶师的死角。苍骑士顺势挥出一记重击。　　　剑尖直插向翅膀根部。刹那间，恶魔的右臂向上挥起，爪子擦过利刃，迸散出火花。　　　　　　　　　　　 １／４苍骑士失去平衡，一脚踏空。恶魔展开追击，其原木般的尾巴倏地扫了过去。　一边惊讶于对方精湛的手法，佩德罗一边令苍骑士翻了个筋斗，避开了尾巴的横扫。　『你还挺有一手嘛。　真没想到是同行啊』蒙面人偶师没有对苍骑士，而是对佩德罗开口说道。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４　苍骑士仿佛要打断这句话一般提剑刺向人偶师。『你唠唠叨叨说些什么！　如果你不过来的话，我可要攻过去了？』事到如今，佩德罗不得不继续佯装毫不知情。缇雅公主则带着不可思议的表情，注视着这一连串奇妙的争论。　『原来如此。是这样啊……』人偶师似乎察觉了事由，小声笑了起来。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４『我也不是不知好歹的人。　如果你希望我保密的话，我也就住口吧。　不过呢……』人偶师的声音，伴随着邪恶的回响。　『你这么没出息，　还想要胜过我的『灾厄』，　实在太天真啦！！』　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

6822|Chapter 12 - The Crimson Demon     The demon doll 'Calamity' kicked the groundand launched itself into the air, closing thegap in an instant.    Pedro reacted just a moment too slow, sointent was he on not wanting the princess tonotice. It was the tiniest of openings, but itwas one that would prove fatal.    First, the sword was knocked from clockworkhands. Then, the claws continued to dig in,cutting through the blue armor like butter.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    'Oh, my, what's wroooong?'    The tail whipped in, encircling the BlueKnight. With a twitch of the puppeteer's fingersthe tail tightened, crushing both the knight'sarms.    'Khehe, caught youuuuuu.'    The claws grabbed the Blue Knight by itsfeathered helm and lifted it up off its feet.    'S-Stop!'    The first puppet he'd made, that he'd put somuch effort into, was being torn to pieces...    Pedro lost himself for a moment and ran　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4forward.    'You are so impatient. No need to worry, Iwas going to give him back.'    The crimson demon held the Blue Knighthigh and threw it down towards Pedro.    'Ghh...!'    The Blue Knight crashed into Pedro andbowled him over. He lay in a crumpled heap uponthe lawn under the body of the puppet.    'Please, stop!'    The princess stepped between the fallen pairand the masked puppeteer, her arms spread wide.　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4     'I offer myself to you.
