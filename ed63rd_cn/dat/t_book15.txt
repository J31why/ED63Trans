In return,I command you to cease this senseless violence!'     At Princess Tia's bold words the puppeteerlicked his lips loudly.    'You'd offer yourself in place of yourguard? Heh heh heh, why, you bring tears to myeyes, Princess.'     'Y-You mustn't, Lady Tia...'　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    Barely conscious, Pedro desperately tried toput words together. He had not the energy to useventriloquism.    'My master... Pedro is fine. Leave it to him...Hurry, run...'     'Sir Pedro. Silence.'     At the princess' angry words, Pedro managedto open his eyes fully, for those words wereaddressed most surely to he, still garbed andacting the servant.　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4    'You... You knew...?'     'I'm sorry. I pretended not to notice.'    The princess smiled in a sad, lonely waythen turned to the puppeteer again with adignified expression.    'Now, take me to my uncle.'    'My, oh, my, what a princess you are. I betyou would have made quite the queen, too.'    The demon slowly stretched out its rightarm. When the princess stepped on, it began tobeat its crimson wings.　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    'Sir Pedro, thank you so much. This lastweek was very fun...'     These words of goodbye sunk into his brain.     As he watched the scarlet shadow beswallowed into the blue sky, Pedro'sconsciousness slowly faded into darkness.    　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第１３话　道别　『我可以任由你处置。　但作为条件，不许你再动手！』　听到缇雅公主威风凛凛的话语，人偶师舔了舔嘴唇，说道。『居然挺身保护自己的护卫？　哈哈哈，公主殿下真是让人感动啊』　『不、不行，公主殿下……』佩德罗虽然就快失去知觉，　　　　　　　　　　 １／４但还是拼命地挤出话语。只不过再也无力使用腹语术。『我的主人……佩德罗他没事的。　这里就交给他……快逃………』　『佩德罗先生。请不要再说下去了』公主的语气仿佛有些愤怒，这让佩德罗睁开了眼睛，凝视着公主。因为刚才这句话，显然是对着伪装成随从的佩德罗本人说的。　　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４『难……难道？』『抱歉。　我一直装作没有发觉』公主带着寂寞的微笑，　然后重新以严肃的表情转向人偶师。　『来，把我带去叔父那里吧』『哎呀呀，真是了不起的公主殿下啊。　本来应该能成为出色的女王陛下的。』恶魔毕恭毕敬地伸出右臂，载上公主，开始拍打红色的翅膀。　　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４『佩德罗先生，谢谢你了。　这一个星期，我非常开心……』离别的话语渗入脑海。　看着那红色的身影消失在蓝天之中，佩德罗的意识也陷入一片黑暗。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

1547|Chapter 14 - The Cost of Deceit     The next morning when Pedro opened his eyes,he found himself in his room at the dollworkshop.    Safe on his familiar, firm bed, he felt arush of relief. It had all been a dream.    Capri called out from the workshop.    'Ohhh, how are you feeling?'    Pedro craned his neck.    On the workbench in the back he glimpseddisassembled blue parts spread out across the　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 3wood.    He leaped up, panicked.    'It...wasn't a dream...'    It seemed Capri had used the Black Priest tobring Pedro and the broken form of the BlueKnight back from the castle.    'It's my fault...'    Pedro's eyes trailed over his formermasterpiece, now reduced to junk.    His memory then trailed back over cool,turquoise-blue eyes, a warm smile like a ray ofsunlight, and fine fingers pouring black tea.　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 3    Pedro ground his lip between his teeth.    'The Blue Knight wasn't good enough. If Ihad any talent as a puppeteer, I would've beenable to protect Princess Tia...!'    'It seems you still don't understand,'Capri muttered.    His face took on a rare expression ofseverity.    'What you lack is here!'     In a forceful motion, he jabbed his fingeragainst Pedro's chest. Pedro could only blink inshock.　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 3|第１４话　欺瞒的代价　第二天早上，佩德罗醒了过来，发现身处人偶工房自己的房间之中。　佩德罗躺在睡惯的软硬适中的床上，安心地以为一切都只是一场梦。『哦，身体状况怎么样了？』从工房传来了卡普利的声音。　里面的工作台上放着一堆七零八落的蓝色零件。　　　　　　　　　　 １／３佩德罗慌忙从床上一跃而起。『原来，不是梦……』看来是卡普利用『黑法师』把佩德罗和苍骑士从王宫带了回来。　『都是我的错……』凝视着苍骑士的残骸，佩德罗用干涩的声调喃喃说道。　绿松石般青蓝透彻的瞳眸。如阳光般和煦温暖的微笑。为佩德罗沏茶的纤纤玉指。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／３佩德罗紧紧咬住了嘴唇。『苍骑士还是不行。　如果我有人偶师的才能，　就能保护缇雅公主了……！』　『看来，你还没有明白啊』卡普利厌烦地小声说道，脸上浮现出从未有过的严肃表情。　『你所欠缺的，是这里！』他严厉地伸手指向佩德罗的胸口，把佩德罗吓得直眨眼。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／３

2903|Chapter 15 - A Little Decision     'Her Highness knew the truth of the BlueKnight. And yet, she chose to pretend not to.Do you really not understand why?'    'B-Because...'    Unexpectedly, in the depths of his mind, hehad a flash of insight.    'Sir Pedro. Silence,' she had said. Andthen, 'I pretended not to notice.'    He recalled the sad, lonely smile she gavehim when she revealed it.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 3    Something hot boiled up inside his chest.     Pedro raised his head and fixed Capri withan intense gaze.    'Master, I beg of you! Help me repair theBlue Knight!'     The old man studied his face.    'The masked puppeteer you fought is a manfeared like a demon in our trade. A half-bakedman can't hope to match him. Do you understand?' 　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 3    'Even so, I will... For the person whobelieved in me!'     When he said this, Capri smiled broadly, asif something grand had just fallen in his lap.     It was the day before the crowning ceremony.At the palace, the princess' absence had beennoticed and the royal keep fell into uproar fromtop to bottom.  　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 3|第１５话　微薄的决心　『殿下已经察觉了苍骑士的真面目。　然而她却假装并不知情，　你真的不知道她这样做的理由吗？』　『那、那是……』忽然间，一段回忆闪过佩德罗的脑海。　『佩德罗先生。请不要再说下去了』公主说出这句话时，表情似乎有些愤怒。『我一直装作没有发觉』　　　　　　　　　　 １／３公主如此坦白的时候，笑容却有些寂寞。佩德罗心中有一股热热的东西涌了上来，　他抬起头，直接面对着卡普利锐利的视线。『师父，拜托了！　请帮我修理苍骑士！』　『与你交战过的蒙面人偶师　在这一行中也是恶魔般令人畏惧的男人。　可不是半吊子的你所能比得了的哦？』　　　　　　　　　　　 ２／３『即使如此，我也要去。　为了那个一直相信我的人！』如此，卡普利才欣然微笑起来。                                   这是在加冕仪式前一天发生的事。此时，王宫上下正因为公主的失踪而乱成一团。　 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ３／３

4087|Chapter 16 - The Duke's Private Manor     On the outskirts of the capital in DukeGaston's manor, Princess Tia sat in a lush roomcarpeted in deep crimson.    'It's perfect for you, Princess.'    With a satisfied expression, Duke Gastonglared at his bound prisoner.     'What do you intend to do about the crowningceremony today?' Princess Tia asked in a quietvoice.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    The duke shrunk a bit under her icy gaze.    'I am afraid you will be absent. And so thethrone and staff will be offered to me, thesecond in line.'    'Do you believe the people will accept you?'    'To change the subject, Tia, I have foundsomeone willing to accept you as a bride.'     Seeing the sky-colored eyes waver for amoment, the duke smiled with renewed confidence.    'He is the second Imperial son and QUITE theconnection.'　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4    The duke's smile widened.    'While you learn the joys of womanhood in anew land you can leave the rest to me.'    It was a cowardly plan.    Certainly, it wasn't a scenario that wouldbe accepted for the duke to take the throne inplace of the first heir. However, it wasdifferent if the princess were to marry. If thatwere to pass, anyone could see that DukeGaston's ascent to the throne was all but a donedeal.    'My lord, it is about time.'　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    At his second-in-command's comment, the dukestood.    'I am sure you are quite tired from thedaily attacks. Take the chance to rest andrecover.'    The duke gave a chuckle at his ownshamelessness and left the room.     At that moment...    'That won't be happening!'    There was a tremendous crash, and a glasswindow exploded into glittering powder.　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第１６话　公爵家别墅　铺着深红色绒毯的穷奢极侈的房间。这就是位于郊外的加斯顿公爵的别墅……　『真是活该啊，缇雅』加斯顿公爵带着满足的表情，瞪着被绑缚在椅子上的公主。　『今天的加冕仪式　您打算怎么办呢？』缇雅公主平静地问道。　　　　　　　　　　 １／４威严的目光，让公爵心生畏惧。　『你将会缺席。　而因此，作为第二王位继承人的我　将被授予皇冠与权杖』『您以为国民会接受吗？』　『让我们换个话题吧，缇雅啊。　我已经为你找好婆家了』公爵看到天蓝色的瞳眸中闪过一丝动摇，露出了无耻的笑容。『是帝国的二皇子，这可真是天作之合呀。　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４　以后的事就交给我，你只要去新天地　找寻作为女人的幸福就好了』　这是何等卑劣的手段啊。由公爵代替作为第一王位继承人的公主即位，的确是不合情理。然而，如果公主出嫁的话就另当别论了。加斯顿公爵的即位最终会被作为既成事实得到认可。　『阁下，差不多到时间了』听到副官的催促，公爵站了起来。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４『每天都遭到袭击，想必已经相当疲惫了吧。　就请您在这里好好休息吧』公爵厚颜无耻地说出这番话来，而后便要走出房间。正当此时……　『这可不行！』　伴随着尖锐的冲击声，玻璃窗连同窗框一起被打飞了。　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４

5874|Chapter 17 - And So the Boy Becomes a Man     Like a graceful leopard, a tall knight cladin blue armor leapt through the window.Following behind him was a small boy wearing acap.    'Princess Tia, I'm sorry. I know I'm a bitlate,' he said.    'Sir Pedro...'    'So you did come, after all.'    A tremulous smile floated onto the princess'face.　　　　　　　　　　 1 / 4    Somewhat embarrassed, the boy returned thesmile. Their eyes locked and words unsaid passedbetween them.    'Hey! There is a time and place for things!'    The duke, having been completely ignored,was sputtering in anger.    As the duke seethed, his second-in-commandwas stealthily sneaking up on the still boundprincess. He reached out his hand for theprincess' shoulder.    The Blue Knight leapt forward like a boltfrom a crossbow.　　　　　　　　　　 2 / 4    'Blargh?!'    The pitiable second-in-command, having takena direct punch from the Blue Knight, collapsedagainst the wall, unconscious.    'Th-That's a bit much...'    Duke Gaston, now white as a sheet, fled theroom in a stumbling lurch.    'Princess Tia, let us hurry! Your crowningceremony begins soon!' Pedro said.    'Yes!'    Escaping the manse, the two were pursued bythe duke and his guard.　　　　　　　　　　 3 / 4    However, as if to obstruct their path, ascarlet shadow fell down, shaking the ground.     'Sorry, but I'm gonna have to get in yourway. I'm afraid thoroughness is the number onepart of being a puppeteer, after all. Hehehe.'    The way he spoke made it hard to believe itwas just a job.     It was the masked puppeteer, Harlequin, andthe crimson demon doll, Calamity. 　　　　　　　　　　 4 / 4|第１７话　于是少年终于成人　如同猎豹一般，身着青色甲胄的高大骑士敏捷而优美地从窗外滑入屋中。当然，还有带着帽子的矮个少年。『缇雅公主，对不起。　我来晚了一点』　『佩德罗先生……　您果然来了』公主破涕为笑。　　　　　　　　　　 １／４少年害羞般地报以微笑。两人的视线紧紧结合在一起。　『喂！　注意一下时间地点啊！』完全被无视的公爵唾沫横飞地叫嚷道。　另一方面，公爵的副官偷偷地靠近被绑住的公主背后。正当他将手伸向公主肩膀之时，苍骑士如弩箭一般逼近过来。　　　　　　　　　　　 ２／４『哇！？』可怜的副官结结实实吃了苍骑士一掌，猛地撞在墙上晕了过去。『真、真是胡闹……』加斯顿公爵脸色苍白，连滚带爬逃出了房间。　『缇雅公主，请快一点！　加冕仪式马上就要开始了！』『好的！』两人逃出宅邸，追在公爵身后。　　　　　　　　　　 ３／４然而，阻住他们去路的是伴随着地面的震动从天而降的红色身影。　『不好意思，我不能让你们过去。　人偶师可是信用第一的呢，哈哈哈』　愉快的腔调完全不像是在执行任务。这就是蒙面人偶师哈雷克因和红色的恶魔人偶『灾厄』。　　　　　　　　　　　　　 ４／４
