		{color 0}[1. Carrying out fundamental research on orbments.]{wait}
		The foundation's most important mission is, naturally,
		the improvement and development of orbal technology.{wait}
		The fundamental principles behind how orbments work
		need no improvement as such, but their architectures--
		their internal structures--have been improved upon
		countless times in the past and will surely continue to
		be perfected by the curious mind as the years go on.{wait}
		Orbments' architecture concerns the mechanical parts

		develops.{wait}

		public of its benefits.]{wait}
		Two other important goals of the foundation are to
		spread orbal technology as widely as possible and
		to educate the public on the correct way to use it.{wait}
		While orbments have become part of the daily lives
		of most who live in advanced nations and populated
		urban areas, the reality in remote and mountainous
		regions is very different.{wait}
		To counter this, we have long worked to send missions
		of engineers and bracers to these regions to try and
		better the standard of living for these people, and will
		continue to do so.{wait}
	} {
		We also continue to work on other ways to spread 
		awareness of orbal technology, such as working
		closely with the Septian Church to have it added to
		the curriculum of Sunday School classes.{wait}

		It is to pursue this noble yet extremely difficult goal
		that the foundation has had a close relationship with
		the Bracer Guild ever since its initial founding.{wait}
		The guild was established as an international peace-
		keeping organization and can mediate on conflicts
		between nations from a neutral point of view, making
		it essential to the stability of our world as it stands.{wait}
		The Epstein Foundation continues to back them up
		fully in their cause, both with financial aid and using
		the fact that Leman State is the only place where
		tactical orbments are produced to provide them with
		equipment.{wait}

		would be able to bring lasting peace to the world.{wait}
		Instead, recent years have thoroughly betrayed
		those hopes, and the post-revolution world has
		been a chaotic one indeed.{wait}
		The conflict between Liberl and Erebonia, for one,
		made significant use of orbal weaponry--airships
